## BLOG
As I explore spiritual healing, multiple faiths, and learn to appreciate broader views around the power (or lack of power) in [churches and church divides](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/what-should-america-do-its-empty-church-buildings/576592/?utm_source=twb) across the world and its languages, I cherish inspiration that motivates and empowers work, health, life, and community engagement. I share inspiration in blogs below.

### 2019: Year of Peace
For over a few years, since high school, I have struggled with today’s top mental health challenges, or “demons.” As mental health challenges persist in today’s world, I bring attention to Jesus Christ’s words, **“Peace, be still”** in 2019. These "demons" don't have to reign; peace can reign this year in our hearts and minds (see [Cleanse the Lepers](https://journal.christianscience.com/issues/2007/1/125-1/cleanse-the-lepers), [Casting out 'demons'](https://journal.christianscience.com/issues/2016/2/134-02/casting-out-demons)).

In December 2018, after wrestling with "Peace, be still", and the fact that I do not always feel peaceful in the human experience, I began to appreciate how **spiritual teachers, behind multiple religious groups that celebrate December holidays, promise peace**. When I heard talk about how "busy and time-pressed" people claim to feel during the holiday month, I started to focus on **"Nirvana"**, "**Shalom"**, and **peace in the "Kingdom of Heaven"**. Rather than react to a negative event, I let the feeling of peace reign in heart and consciousness as much as possible.

To feel more peace, I started attending a **[meditation meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Meditation-on-Twin-Hearts-Meetup/)** that supports participants in **serving as an "instrument of peace"**. One night, after the meetup group, a taxi cab hit me while walking across the street. As a result of the spiritual work I had done to focus on letting peace reign in heart and mind, I barely reacted to the accident; I stood up freely, and I felt pain vanish in all parts of my body but my arm. I devoted energy to focus on what right happened in the situation rather than what wrong, celebrating the inherent ability to stay peaceful.

**Moving into 2019, I focus this New Year on peace, freedom from distress, and peacemaking! In all situations in 2019, I set the intention to learn to recognize, celebrate, feel, ane make peace.**

On New Year's day, while setting this intention, and expressing gratitude for any new insights I gain this year, I purchased a book, **["God in the Qur'an"](https://www.amazon.com/God-Quran-Three-Classic-Scriptures/dp/0307269574)**. The book compares Bible passages with Qur'an passages. I left the bookshop and headed to the coffeeshop with love directed to interfaith, diverse cultures, and the the Qur'an's spiritual message; as taught in **the Qur'an, ["Allah", "God", exists as a compassionate, loving, and wise source of peace](https://www.whyislam.org/brochures/conceptofgod/)**. In the coffeeshop, I met a homeless man, who asked me for money to go to a homeless shelter an hour away. I did not have cash, but I asked if I could help him pray about the situation. When he said he would be glad if I could pray, I responded with **the inspiration, "Love (Divine) is guiding you, always, and you're unconditionally blessed."** As soon as I said this, he started holding my hand and recalling how he finds "listening to the Qur'an" healing. As we talked, another man from the Islam faith overheard and joined the discussion. We had a great conversation about **Allah**, **[the prophets in the Qur'an](https://www.whyislam.org/islam/belief-in-prophets/)**, including **[Jesus, the Galilean prophet](https://biblelesson.christianscience.com/related-information/tenets-of-christian-science)**, and **comparisons between Christianity and Islam**. **The man from the Islam faith ultimately provided the money to the homeless man; and God, Allah provided us all our needs in peace.** **What a great way to kick off the new year! It helps to live with more conviction, and I look forward to see what unfolds this year.**

### Interfaith, and Renewal of Faith and Understanding 
#### Background
I have grown up around **multiple faiths and religions**: **[Catholic](https://www.catholic.org/)**, **[Presbyterian](https://www.presbyterianmission.org/)**, **[Episcopalian](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/topics/worldwide)**, **[Christian Science](https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/)**, **[Orthopaedics](https://www.aaos.org/Default.aspx?ssopc=1)**, **[Jungian Psychiatry](http://jungiansociety.org/)**, **[Judaism](http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en)** and I have desired to understand **[Buddhism](http://www.buddhanet.net/)**. I interned one summer with the **[Christian Science Mother Church](https://www.christianscience.com/find-us/visit-the-mother-church)**, even if peers, or my inner critic thought that "Christian Science is weird", "not a real Science", or "not powerful enough to heal truly". Since entering the workforce outside the church, I have wrestled with **what is true** in sciences, faiths, religions, and socially intractable problems.

#### Healing Testimony
During and outside work, I have meditated and watched thoughts with inspiration, though sometimes it feels like I am struggling to find **breath** and **full health**. In situations when it feels like **death's shadow** controls me, I have slowly turned to **God, or ["God Consciousness"](https://articles.plainfieldcs.com/early-workers/bicknell-young/consciousness-where-art-thou/)**, where there might exist hope to free oneself from human cycles and finite senses power; when I discover with God's help that I dwell within His loving consciousness, I see more of Divine Life's infinitely expanding expression. 

When I had a headache during summer 2018 at a company palooza, rather than drinking more water or taking medication, I decided to practice Christian Science treatment; I stated a few times the following: **"There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error."** Rather than not go to a company party, **I went to the party with this prayer in my heart -- I went to the party praying that all unlike God in my life and socially intractable problems can clear away with God's all-one-ness and power -- to God, there is no problem because Man is made in God's image and likeness with joy, freedom to move, the ability to express, and perfect health***. I felt so joyful at the party and free to dance without any self-consciousness. 

Since then, I've continued to experience waves of doubt in my daily walk; but I work with spiritual teachers to find freedom, and I wrestle through conversations with the divine power that says, "Peace, be still" and "Rejoice". **I believe in the beauty of a broader Life that can be expressed through this world with divine-motivated dedication to practicing love and generosity, seeing a world more bright, and feeling the divine universe's control unconditionally.** 

#### Onward
While I have moments when I feel anger, frustration, or despair, with a spiritual foundation, I continuously renew love for myself, this world, and work being done across worldly divisions.

Recently, in moments, when I feel like I **really *cannot* breathe**, I consciously breathe humanly, and I also affirm that the **"Christ animates me"** and that **the Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost breathes through me**. Affirming this gives me more fullness of breath. The Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost daily inspires us with great thoughts, good vibrations, the ability to move, and Life's breath.

I will use this page to share **heavenly inspiration** that can empower us all through **overdoses of material medication**, **death's shadow**, and **the most terrorizing, abusive traps in our lives**.

#### A Note on Multiple Faiths and Religions 
The study of Buddhism helps me understand Christian Science. The study of other scientific, technological, and metaphysical theories encourages me to think hard about whether I truly believe Christian metaphysics is the Truth. My attendance at Catholic mass and Presbyterian and Episcopalian church services strengthens my heart and mind when I hear the power of their prayers. The study of Christian Science illumines the light on existence, on Buddhism, and on prayers that church attendees sing in a diversity of Christian sects. The study of Christian metaphysics enlightens psychiatric, psychological, and philosophical theories. With daily wrestling, I begin to realize that **we all are coexisting whether we want to or not in one universe** -- **and with one Truth, one Father, one Breath, one Spirit, one Creative Power, one Life, one Science of Being, and one Source of Hope, where we cannot clash, multiply divides, fight, or experience eternal destruction.**
