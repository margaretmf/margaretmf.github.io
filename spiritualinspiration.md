## BLOG
I have grown up around multiple faiths and religions: Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Christian Science, Orthopedics, Jungian Psychiatry, Judaism and I have desired to understand Buddhism. I interned one summer with the Christian Science Mother Church, even if peers, or my inner critic thought that 
"Christian Science is weird", "not a real Science", nor not "powerful enough to heal truly". Since entering the workforce outside of the church, I have been wrestling a lot with what is **true** in sciences, faiths, and religions, and I have been meditating a lot with inspirations sometimes struggling to find **breath**. In situations that feel like the **shadow of death**, I have slowly turned back to God, or "God Consciousness", where there might be hope to free oneself from from human cycles and finite senses. When I had a headache during the Summer of 2018, rather than drinking more water or taking medication, I decided to practice Christian Science treatment; I stated a few times the following: "There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error." Rather than not go to a company party, I went to the party with this prayer, praying that all unlike God clear away, I felt so joyful the entire time and free to dance without any self-conscious fears. I still experience waves of doubt, and I work with spiritual teachers to help me find freedom. I believe in the beauty of a broader Life that can be expressed through this world with dedication to practicing love and generosity, seeing a world more bright, and feeling the divine universe's control unconditionally.
