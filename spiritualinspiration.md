### Introduction 
#### Background
**I have grown up around multiple faiths and religions: [Catholic](https://www.catholic.org/), [Presbyterian](https://www.presbyterianmission.org/), [Episcopalian](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/topics/worldwide), [Christian Science](https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/), [Orthopaedics](https://www.aaos.org/Default.aspx?ssopc=1), [Jungian Psychiatry](http://jungiansociety.org/), [Judaism](http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en) and I have desired to understand [Buddhism](http://www.buddhanet.net/)**. I interned one summer with the [Christian Science Mother Church](https://www.christianscience.com/find-us/visit-the-mother-church), even if peers, or my inner critic thought that "Christian Science is weird", "not a real Science", nor not "powerful enough to heal truly". Since entering the workforce outside of the church, I have been wrestling a lot with what is **true** in sciences, faiths, religions, and socially intractable problems.

#### Healing Testimony
During and outside of work, I have been meditating and watching thoughts a lot with inspiration, though sometimes it feels like I am struggleing to find **breath** and **full health**. In situations when it feels like the **shadow of death** is controlling me, I have slowly turned back to **God, or "God Consciousness"**, where there might exist hope to free oneself from from human cycles and finite senses. 

When I had a headache during the summer of 2018 a company palooza, rather than drinking more water or taking medication, I decided to practice Christian Science treatment; I stated a few times the following: **"There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error."** Rather than not go to a company party, *I went to the party with this prayer in my heart -- **I went to the party praying that all unlike God in my life and socially intractable problems can clear away with God's all-one-ness and power -- to God, there is no problem because Man is made in God's image and likeness with joy, freedom to move, and perfect health***. I felt so joyful at the party and free to dance without any self-conscious fears. 

Since then, I've continued to experience waves of doubt in my daily walk; but I work with spiritual teachers to help me find freedom, and I wrestle through conversations with the divine power that says, "Peace, be still" and "Rejoice". **I believe in the beauty of a broader Life that can be expressed through this world with divine-modivated dedication to practicing love and generosity, seeing a world more bright, and feeling the divine universe's control unconditionally.** 

#### Onward
While I have moments when I feel anger, frustration, or despair, I am continuously renewing love for myself, this world, and work being done across worldly divisions.

Recently, in moments, when I feel like I ***really*** **cannot** ***breathe***, I consciously breath humanly, but I've also affirmed that the **"Christ animates me"** and that **the Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost breathes through me**. Affirming this gives me more fullness of breath. The Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost is daily inspiring us with great thoughts, good vibrations, the ability to move, and Life's breath.

I will use this page to share **heavenly doses of inspiration** that can empower us all through **overdoses of material medication**, the **shadow of death**, and **the most terrorizing, abusive traps in our lives**.

#### A Note on Multiple Faiths and Religions 
The study of Buddhism helps me understand Christian Science. The study of other scientific, technological, and metaphysical theories encourages me to think really hard about whether I truly believe Christian metaphysics is the Truth. My attendance at Catholic mass and Presbyterian and Episcopalian church services softens my heart when I hear the powers of their prayers. The study of Christian Science illumines the light on existence, on Buddhism, and on prayers that church attendees sing in a diversity of Christian sects. The study of Christian metaphysics enlightens psychiatric, psychological, and philosophical theories. With daily wrestling, I cling to the fact that **we all are coexisting whether we want to or not in one universe** -- ***and hopefully, with one Truth, one Father, one Hope, one Spirit, one Breath, one Creative Power, one Life, one Science of Being, where we cannot clash, multiply divides, and fight to the point of eternal destruction.***
