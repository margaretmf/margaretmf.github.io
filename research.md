## How is History Shared? How Do We Appreciate and Share the Past? ##
English teachers define "romance" as "somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the actual and imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other."

People tell stories about the past to share what people overcome, the life lessons people learned, how people lived their lives, and how people loved.

It's great to appreciate the best parts of our nation, our families, and our past. Stories of the past teach people lessons. People can learn to express the qualities they've heard others express. People can appreciate the reality of today that has evolved from the reality of yesterday.

It's also great to learn from the dark aspects of the past.

Romanticizing the past stems from feeling like people have lost something from the past. Romanticizing the past also stems from glorifying a past that was not as pretty in reality. Aspects of the past still remain present today in new forms. Through stories, people can take up dark aspects of the past and learn from them. Also through stories, people can take up hidden realities not fully covered in traditional ones.

Sharing history helps people understand why the world is the way it is, and how our ancestors made decisions. Sharing stories from the past differs from believing that the past is better than the present in an imaginary, however.

"Intelligence": cognitive functions, "learning, reasoning, manipulating information, and identifying patterns and relationships, solving problems, recall, planning"

Even with someone with a "borderline intellectual deficit", and "no apparent deficits", there may be needs to engage "health assessment and treatment."

"People with intellectual disability": "learn and process information more slowly", have time with "money, time, and subtleties of interpersonal interactions" and "cultural nuances"


* "Usually recognizes familiar people and has strong relationships with key people in their lives."
* "Most will have little or no speech and will rely on facial expression and body language and gestures to express their needs or feelings and those interacting with and supporting them must be active and keen observers in interpreting changes in a person's demeanor or behavior"
* "Communication systems for people with this level of disability generally rely on photographs or objects to faciliate understanding, e.g. a picture of a cup, or the cup itself, may be used in conjunction with the spoken question"
* "People with severe/profound disabilities will require lifelong assistance in personal care tasks, communication, and support in accessing community facilities/services"


"Many people find the subtleties of interpersonal relationships and social rules difficult to understand (particulary as adolescents) and may inadvertently transgress social boundaries."

Recognizing that someone has intellectual disability

## [Should Music Be Used in Occupational Therapy?](https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1874468) ##
The healing power of music - many cultures, for many centuries

Music, dance therapy

"Nothing is more laden with emotional associations"
"Nothing is more capable of recreating situations"

Therapeutic modality

Disorders, psychoses

"Occupational therapy addresses the dysfunction found in a wide variety of psychiatric, developmental, and physical disorders."


## [Music & Sound Therapy](https://www.ot-innovations.com/music-sound-therapy/) ##
"Music is a very powerful sensory modulation tool! The therapeutic effects of music on the nervous system are well researched. Literature states that a 60 beat per minute pulse can help entrain healthy internal rhythms. Some important considerations before using music in the environment or during OT treatment sessions include the following: diagnosis, age, culture, environment, personal preferences, sensitivities, and personal history."

"Slower paced music with a consistent and predictable rhythm is known for having calming effects on the system, while upbeat & quick paced music is generally alerting and facilitates action/movement. Some popular examples are listed below:

Ambient music encompasses a variety of music; most common today are many of the 'relaxation tapes' widely available on the market. The purpose of these recordings is to produce a general state of relaxation.

Bach & Pachabel: These compositions are consistent and predictable, and have a pulse of approximately 50-70 beats per minute.

Mozart or Hayden: There is continuity, clarity, and order in these compositions – although they have greater changes in rhythm, time, and color than that of Baroque.

Tchaikovsky or Beethoven: Emotional and dynamic compositions known for their strong rhythms, emotional context changes, and unique sound textures which tend to stimulate the imagination."


## [Music as a Therapeutic Medium for Occupational Engagement: Implications for Occupational Therapy] ##
"Music is a meaningful occupation; a summary of current literature and the authors’ experiences regarding health and wellness benefits and potential for music as a therapeutic medium in occupational therapy practice is presented. An interview and a summary of the authors’ experiences illustrate the role for music and its benefits for occupational therapy. These benefits are described through three themes which emerged: (a) music as a means of increasing group cohesion toward common goals, (b) music as a means of increasing socialization, and (c) music as a meaningful occupation can empower individuals to enhance and embrace wellness and recovery."


## [Occupational Therapy](https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/practice/mentalhealth/focus-on-mental-health-booklet.pdf) ##
"Studies investigating the neurology of music show links between music and cognitive function. In a meta-analysis, music has been found to play a catalytic role in hippocampal-dependent temporal order learning, spatiotemporal reasoning, memory, recall, focus modulation, attention span, attention range in left neglect, sensory-motor learning, auditory verbal learning, emotional adjust- ment, motor/executive function, and psychosocial function (Thaut et al., 2009). With vast neuronal associations in the brain, the use of music in therapy can be individualized to facilitate cogni- tive remediation using the brain’s natural neuroplastic tendency. Experiencing music requires both cerebral and limbic involvement (Thaut et al., 2009). Because both regions are involved, music can be used to address the interconnectivity and communication between these brain areas without requiring verbal capability. Listening to music addresses sensory and emotional pathways, whereas playing music requires coordination, timing, proprioception, and memory."

## [Standardization in the Lumber Industry: Trade Journals, Builder's Guides and the American Home](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1555&context=hp_theses) ##
"Many of writings about the American home are directly or peripherally related to the American lumber industry. This body of written work ranges from scholarly theories, to historical analyses, to memoirs about one’s experience in their home, to technical manuals and trade journals, based upon the desired audience. Authors explore the American home from many angles: descriptions of personal home construction, urbanization, suburbanization, and industrialization in twentieth century construction. Many published works link stylistic changes in building construction to a wide range of factors: technological improvements to building materials, new appliances for in-home use, the expanding role of women in the home, and the proliferation of pattern books due to improvements in book printing and distribution. Similarly, home construction is explored through the lumber production and the home improvement industry.

Within of these genres, unifying themes emerge and develop into a cohesive whole that shapes the way Americans think about the idea of home.

The lumber industry is among the oldest manufacturing industries in America. Its expansion was fueled by growing cities and expansion into the great west. The industry focused on logging and timber production to meet the growing demands of northeastern cities. Lumbering was known for its extreme fragmentation, as forests, sawmills, and retail outlets were often owned by different entities. Additionally, logging operations and transportation of products to the mills and lumber yards were controlled by still more companies. This far-reaching supply network was slow to react to changes in demand for products. As new materials were invented, including gypsum wallboard and mass-produced millwork, lumberyards were reluctant to stock these goods as they feared this would detract from their lumber sales. Additionally, lumberyards were often located on the outskirts of town along rail spurs due to their demands for easy rail access and large spatial requirements. The intended audience of lumber distributors was also in flux during this time period: while they needed to maintain their core audience of home- building professionals, many lumber dealers recognized that marketing their products directly to consumers (or “home handymen”) could reap financial rewards. Their remote locations and limited audience also slowed their rate of change and insolated them from modernizations that were occurring elsewhere in society.

American Dream. In The American Family Home, 1800-1960, Clifford Edward Clarke, Jr discusses the notion of the 'American Dream,' including its history and precedents. Clarke generalizes that among the middle class, homes are a symbol of upward mobility. Specific housing types begin to dominate the landscape as features of everyday life are shared by most households. Clarke also describes that competition with one’s neighbors often accompanies the notion of home ownership. Similarly, in Where We Lived: Discovering the Places We Once Called Home: The American Home from 1775 to 1840, Jake Larkin uses photographs, drawings, and documents from the Historic American Buildings Survey to reflect on the development of American home construction. Larkin’s stated goal is to depict a house as a machine for living, while taking into account what those homes mean to the individuals or families that live there. In The Evolving House: A History of the Home, Albert Farwell Bemis and John Burchard show that homes evolve over time due changing societal expectations and inhabitant requirements.

Many authors have written scholarly books on the role of American home in society. These books place the home at the center of many societal reforms, including the women’s movement and the settlement house movement. Gwendolyn Wright’s Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in America chronicles the American domestic environment as it evolves from the earliest colonial architecture through urban renewal schemes and mass-development projects. Wright links thirteen different kinds of dwellings to architectural and ideological models that play an important role in the development of American society and common culture. David Handlin’s The American Home: Architecture and Society, 1815-1915 analyzes the diverse impacts of the home on the development of early American society and 
popular culture. Handlin, an architect and teacher, begins with the Colonial period; and presents the role of Andrew Jackson Downing on the form of American homes as well as references to home in the writings of Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau. These books enrich our understanding of the home as they speak to the importance and relevance in a larger context.

Thus it is crucial that the technical ingenuity and industrial heritage of the American lumber industry is preserved before all remains are relegated to a museum and replaced by new technology. While the production of modern engineered wood products has created a niche market within the industry, new modified and augmented lumber released each year slowly replace their predecessors that contain only wood. Historians, documentarians and preservationists must soon act to record this stalwart of American manufacturing before the lumber industry ceases to exist altogether."

## [Trucking and Automation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/20/rigged-system-rips-off-port-truckers-editorials-debates/103015290/) ##
"Many U.S. consumers care deeply about the way their products are made. Some insist on buying American; others press corporations for codes of conduct that forbid sweatshops in foreign lands.

"But what many might not know is that some highly deplorable conditions exist right here in America, in the transport of goods rather than their manufacture.

A huge volume of the nation's imports arrive by container ship in Southern California, where short-haul truckers take the merchandise to nearby rail yards or storage depots, a key step in the goods' journey to some of the nation's leading retail stores. A year-long investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that a good chunk of the port trucking industry relies heavily on a modern-day form of indentured servitude.

The abuse starts when a trucking company pressures its drivers to sign lease-to-own contracts on their tractor-trailer rigs. Often, these drivers speak little English and do not understand what they are getting into."


"Network reporter Brett Murphy documented hundreds of cases like this at Los Angeles ports since 2010, including 1,150 instances in which drivers had filed formal complaints, 140 trucking companies that had been accused by at least one driver of shorting drivers on pay, and more than 120 cases in which drivers said they worked 12 to 20 hours at a time, in violation of federal highway safety laws."


"Federal law has numerous workplace protections, but only for employees. The trucking companies at the Port of Los Angeles classify their drivers, incorrectly in many cases, as independent contractors rather than employees."


"If a category of worker is to exist outside of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other workplace protection laws, Congress needs to either delegate workplace authority to the states, or set minimum standards to protect contract workers against exploitation."


"The industry points to a study stating that drivers like being independent contractors. But the study is commissioned by the industry, uses data not available to outsiders, and includes long-haul drivers as well as the port truckers who are the subject of so much abuse."


## [Review: The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream](https://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2017/10/review-big-rig-trucking-and-decline-american-dream) ##
"Truck drivers seem to have re-entered the public consciousness in 2017—but today our understanding of the occupation is far from the freewheeling “cowboy of the highway” image of the 1970s. It’s also no longer synonymous with “Teamster” or even seen as a desirable job.

These days most talk about truckers centers on self-driving vehicles and the prospect that more than three million professional drivers will be replaced by robots. Business writers excitedly write about how this “cost-saving” technology lies just around the corner, only briefly pausing to consider the social crisis that would be created by laying off so many workers.

As a truck driver myself, I know that so much of what we do is far too complicated to be replaced by technology any time soon. We do a lot more than just hold a steering wheel. We navigate city streets and highways that are perpetually “under construction,” deal with distracted drivers who spend more time looking at their phones than at the road, maneuver impossibly narrow spaces to make deliveries, and back trailers up to dock doors, sometimes across traffic, with no room for error—and that's just what we do from the driver’s seat, not counting time for inspections, dropping and hooking, loading and unloading."


"As 27-year driver Greg Simmons says in a recent New York Times profile of long-haul truckers, “We’re throwaway people. Nobody cares about us.” Simmons says he feels trapped in an occupation that no longer provides a decent living, thanks to corporate innovations like the pay-by-mile system, which doesn’t account for all the hours drivers get stuck in traffic or wait on trailers to be loaded or unloaded, a process that often takes hours.

For truckers at the ports who move goods from ships to warehouses, the situation is even worse. An in-depth USA Today report (June 20, 2017) exposed the terrible conditions faced by immigrants driving trucks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, describing their situation as “modern-day indentured servitude.”

Many port truckers are locked into lease agreements in which a large portion of their wages goes toward their truck and vehicle maintenance. Their bosses use these leasing agreements to force drivers into punishing schedules, threatening them with losing their truck (and forfeiting all the wages paid into the truck) if they refuse to work beyond the legal maximum hours or if they get sick and can't work. They are also often misclassified as “independent contractors,” depriving drivers of basic protections like overtime compensation, family and medical leave, and unemployment insurance."


"Deregulation, beginning with President Carter and continued by Ronald Reagan, did away with the federal permit system and encouraged thousands of new carriers to enter the industry. By dramatically increasing competition, both shipping prices and wages were driven down considerably. It became more affordable for shippers to use 'truckload' shipments, where a trailer is filled exclusively with one shipper’s freight and sent directly to its destination, instead of relying on the union-dense “less than truckload” terminals to move smaller shipments."

## [Alone on the Open Road: Truckers Feel Like ‘Throwaway People’](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/trucking-jobs.html) ##


## [Rigged](https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/rigged-forced-into-debt-worked-past-exhaustion-left-with-nothing/) ##
"Most days, the trucker would drive more than 16 hours straight hauling LG dishwashers and Kumho tires to warehouses around Los Angeles, on their way to retail stores nationwide."


"He rarely went home to his family. At night, he crawled into the back of his cab and slept in the company parking lot."


"Talavera was a modern-day indentured servant. And there are hundreds, likely thousands more, still on the road, hauling containers for trucking companies that move goods for America’s most beloved retailers, from Costco to Target to Home Depot.

These port truckers -- many of them poor immigrants who speak little English -- are responsible for moving almost half of the nation’s container imports out of Los Angeles’ ports. They don't deliver goods to stores. Instead they drive them short distances to warehouses and rail yards, one small step on their journey to a store near you.

A yearlong investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that port trucking companies in southern California have spent the past decade forcing drivers to finance their own trucks by taking on debt they could not afford. Companies then used that debt as leverage to extract forced labor and trap drivers in jobs that left them destitute.

Using the contracts, submitted as evidence in labor complaints, and shipping manifests, reporters matched the trucking companies with the most labor violations to dozens of retail brands, including Target, Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot, Hasbro, J.Crew, UPS, Goodyear, Costco, Ralph Lauren and more.

This isn’t a case of a few bad trucking companies accused of mistreating a handful of workers.

Since 2010, at least 1,150 port truck drivers have filed claims in civil court or with the California Department of Industrial Relations’ enforcement arm, known as the labor commission."


"Prominent civil rights leader Julian Bond once called California port truckers the new black tenant farmers of the post-Civil War South. Sharecroppers from that era rented farmland to make their living and regularly fell into debt to their landlords. Widespread predatory practices made it nearly impossible for the farmers to climb out.

Through lease contracts, California’s port truckers face the same kinds of challenges in ways that experts say rarely happen in the U.S. today.

You’re working to get yourself out of the debt. You just don’t see anything like that.

Reporters tried to contact owners and managers at more than 30 trucking companies. Many did not respond or declined to comment."


"Retailers don't directly hire the truckers who move their goods at the pier. They generally hire large shipping or logistics firms that line up trucking companies through a maze of subcontractors."


"Truckers at dozens of companies describe the same basic scene. They were handed a lease-to-own contract by their employer and given a choice: Sign immediately or be fired. Many drivers who spoke little English said managers gave them no time to seek legal advice or even an interpreter to read the contract

Drivers gave their old trucks – many of which they owned outright – to their company as a down payment. And just like that they were up to $100,000 in debt to their own employer. The same guys would have had a tough time qualifying for a Hyundai days earlier."


"For years, Rene Flores regularly has driven 20 hours a day, six days a week, hauling pistachios and medical equipment into the desert from the Port of Long Beach.

'If I don’t work,” Flores says, “my kids will starve.'

He keeps a log book of fake hours in the glovebox and the real one hidden beneath his seat in case of a surprise inspection."

## [Southern White Patriarchy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335328771_Southern_White_Patriarchy) ##
"The pedestal upon which southern white womanhood stands is buttressed by an equally sacred southern white masculinity characterized by a distorted notion of honor, a penchant for violence, and male righteousness and superiority. Thus, Second-Wave Feminism spurred not only a defiant anti-feminism with which many white southern men and women identified, but also a men’s rights campaign that portrayed men as victims of reverse discrimination and promoted a dominant and defensive masculinity that was very familiar to southern white audiences. This misogyny, along with a religious assertion of manhood that was popular in southern evangelical churches, provided Republicans with an opportunity to build their partisan brand among white southerners. Often masked by romanticized notions of chivalry, southern white masculinity depends upon a patriarchal system and the traditional gender roles inherent in that system. The GOP would appeal to both as it chased southern white voters throughout the Long Southern Strategy."

## [Crying Shame: The Power of White Woman's Tears](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/crying-shame-the-power-of-white-women-s-tears-20190820-p52iy7.html) ## 
"One of the earliest critiques of White Womanhood comes from one of the most underrated figures of the suffragette era. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was a poet, journalist, fiction writer and a formidable presence on the abolitionist speakers’ circuit.

In 1866 she gave a far-sighted speech at the 11th National Women’s Rights Convention in New York City before a crowd that included key suffragist figures Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.

'We are all bound up in one great bundle of humanity, and society can’t trample on the weakest and feeblest among its members without receiving the curse in its own soul,' she declared.

You white women speak of rights, I speak of wrongs. I do not believe that giving white women the ballot is immediately going to cure all the ills of society. I do not believe that white women are dew-drops just exhaled from the skies.

Harper argued the condition of poor white men in the South was a direct consequence of the law favouring rich slave-owners: in enslaving black men, white men paralysed the moral strength of the nation and the rights of lower-class whites. Likewise, in the cities of the North, white women were turning away when black women tried to hail streetcars only to find the conductor refused to let them ride.

'Have women nothing to do with this? While there exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and selfishness, it is the white women of America.'

The key, then, to white women’s liberation lay in whether or not they considered black women to be women like themselves, and in using this recognition as the first step in building a fairer society. Sadly, those white women didn’t and arguably many still don’t. Rather than rejecting the concept of white women as virtuous "dew-drops" inherently equipped to right the wrongs of their white male counterparts, white women have largely chosen to navigate and bolster the existing system to gain some advantages, which necessarily come at the expense of people of colour. And this has meant adopting the persona of the damsel in distress.

Perhaps no story encapsulates this more clearly and tragically than that of Emmett Till. The 14-year-old from Chicago was visiting family in 1955 Mississippi when he was accused of whistling at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant. Abducted by a group of white men including Bryant’s husband, he was beaten to death and dumped in the Tallahassee River. His killers were acquitted by an all-white jury. In 2018, Bryant recanted her testimony, admitting Till had not harassed her in any way.

This is the power of the white damsel in distress. It is a power that is not in the past.

We see this modern-day dynamic of white women’s innocence and virtue used as a justification for the oppression of brown and black bodies in the rhetoric of our politicians. Last year, US President Donald Trump invoked the protection of women as a rationale for demonising the so-called 'migrant caravan' - the dehumanising name given to the thousands of people attempting to make their way from Central America to the US border in the hope of finding safety. He conjured up the image of the white damsel, saying, ‘Women want security. Women don’t want that caravan’, echoing the messages of slavery, segregation and more recent white supremacist literature.

In 1997, sociologist Abby L. Ferber published White Man Falling, a discourse analysis of newsletters and magazines printed by white supremacist groups. What she found, along with a preoccupation with 'saving' Western civilisation and restoring the reputation of the white Western male, was an obsession with policing the bodies of white women and the borders of 'white' countries.

'America is being invaded by a deluge of legal and illegal non-White intruders: swarms of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Negro, Oriental and Jewish scum who are thronging across our wide-open borders,' thundered one publication, arguing that this 'unarmed invasion' threatened the white race because of the possibility of white women 'crossbreeding with inferior specimens', which would lead to the end of the white race through the contamination of white blood with 'inferior blood'.

The logic of policing racial boundaries is not new. It is the foundation that all settler-colonies were built on.

'I am being harassed': Damsels in distress

The white damsel has enjoyed an online resurgence in this era of viral memes, and the past couple of years have seen a proliferation of white women caught on camera in the United States calling the police on black people for simply existing.

Perhaps no meme better exposes the dangerous fiction that lies at the heart of the white damsel in distress trope than 'BBQ Becky'. In this viral video, a middle-aged white woman can be seen on her mobile phone angrily requesting police show up to eject a black family barbecuing in a park. After many words of consternation between Becky and the white woman who is filming her, a defiant Becky refuses to return a business card belonging to the other woman and storms off.

The camera follows her, and the transformation in Becky’s demeanour is remarkable to witness. In a matter of minutes, she goes from assertive to combative to aggressive to defiant, and finally, when she spots and rushes towards a bewildered-looking white male police officer, becomes the white damsel in distress. Bursting into tears when she reaches her apparent rescuer, she manages to heave out a few words between gulping sobs: 'I am being harassed.'

This incident demonstrates that white women are not only aware of their privileged status in society but use it to surreptitiously manipulate and dominate people of colour, only to resort to the damsel in distress archetype of white female innocence and victimhood when challenged.

The original damsel in distress trope was a way for white women to exercise some limited power. I say 'limited' not because it didn’t have far-reaching effects but because it required white women to adhere to strict rules to be accepted. The damsel is an infantilised woman whose purity and innocence is both inherent and sanctified, leading to her perceived reliance on men and to the obsession with virginity that persists even in a Western world that is supposedly sexually liberated.

The damsel ensured white women were at least considered human, even though it relegated them to subordinate status. But it did so by ruthlessly excluding non-white women from the construction of womanhood. It is not that non-white women were considered inferior to white women: they were not considered to be women at all. The damsel can only be white.

Only white women were considered worthy of protecting, because only white women could ensure the continuation of a 'pure white race'. Black women, Indigenous women, brown women: all colonised women were regarded as lacking in innocence because their bodies were already freely, openly and liberally transgressed by white men.

When white women invoke the damsel, they resurrect this bloody history. This is what makes white women’s tears so damaging and, yes, so violent when they are turned against people of colour. White women’s tears have little effect on white men - just ask Christine Blasey Ford, whose emotional testimony was not enough to prevent her alleged abuser being confirmed to the US Supreme Court - because they were never designed to implicate white men. This is why sexual violence by white men was rarely punished historically and why to this day so many white people still react so blithely to sexual assault and domestic violence perpetrated by white men, even when the victims are white women. This is why a self-confessed 'pussy grabber' can be elected president of the United States.

To be a white man in the white supremacist construction is to have the right to sexual access to all women, while at the same time sequestering the bodies of white women to prevent men of colour ingratiating themselves into white society.

A white man raping a white woman is not a threat to white male power. If it threatens to destroy the woman’s life then so be it. This, I believe, is why despite all our claims our society still does not take violence against women seriously. When perpetrated by white men, frequently such violence is ignored or blame heaped onto the victim. It is only when white women are violated or even imagined to be violated by non-white men that white society suddenly seems to find its moral compass.

This is not to say that men of colour never assault white women - they do - but the scale of the white fear of brown and black men raping innocent white women with no repercussions is a gross perversion of the historical reality. White fear betrays deep-seated anxieties about white men being "replaced" at the top of the racial and gender hierarchy and white society collapsing; I don’t mean the total destruction of society here - merely it no longer being solely in the control of white men and women.

White people as a collective still fear sharing power and status. They fear no longer being the special race. The Enlightened race. The civilised and civilising race. This is obvious to anyone watching the rise of right-wing 'populism', the alt-right and the resurgence of neo-Nazis. Perhaps, as people of colour half-joke, white people fear being treated the way they have long treated the minorities they have subordinated. At the very least, there appears to be a complete denial that the only thing that has made white people 'superior' is their own insistence that they are."

"The cowgirls of today were born of the Eastern settlers from the period of the Western settlement, or Manifest Destiny. These women came from the East to settle and establish a new life with their husbands and families, with a focused goal to 'tame' the West. The pioneer women wore prairier dresses and bonnets, focused on education, and worked long hard hours to feed, clothe, and even protect their families from danger. These women were known as 'Prairie Madonnas' who 'made great pies, babies, and flour sack curtains...She kept immaculate house under impossible conditions - floors of raw dirt or unfinished woo' and she 'could handle a gun or help with the stock if her husband were away when the Indians attacked or if the cows broke down the fence."

"A popular writer from this era was Laura Ingalls Wilder"

"the Western frontier"

"the cowboy image"
"the frontier cowboys"

"culture", "a way of life"

"This book is about moving marginalized individuals in rodeo to the center; however, we cannot possibly tell the whole story. The ignorance of history, a belief in a White Western narrative that erased the contributions of Lation/as, American Indians, and African Americans, and the effects of racism and White privilege are why all those in rodeo are believed to be either White and/or White males. We are unable to resurrect those cowgirls likely that Wister saw and had knowledge of Latino, American Indian, and African American cowboys. Wister also knew that women were in the West, and yet their participation is erased, as well. In Wister's revisionist telling of the 'wild West' he recounts and admires only the hard, industrious work of White men. Through the creation of *The Virginian*, in 1902, Wister 'created the archetypal cowboy hero stamped with particular qualities that virtually all his successors would perpetuate. The creation of the archetypal cowboy and the use of the White man to be the hero to fight the villains of the West (normally seen as the 'Wild' Indian or Mexican 'Desperado'), and saving White women from the dangers of the West established rigid gender stereotypes. The establishment of these gender roles helped influence the positions that owmen and ethnic minorities have in modern rodeo, because they reifed the social norms and themes that were constructed in the United States for what was appropriate for each group of people. Wister's focus on admiration for the White race sat well with his contemporaries like Rudyard Kipling, as well as with other U.S. policy and laws of the time. For example, in 1896 the U.S. Supreme Court passed the Federal Plessy v. Ferguson law, which ushered in Jim Crow, or a 'separate but equal' policy, which segregated Black and White Americans. This Federal law remained in place through 1964. In addition, in 1900 White males in the U.S. elected William McKinley, who further popularized Kipling's 1899 poem 'The White Man's Burden,' a treatise on 'the white man's burden' belief, which focused on cultural and racial imperialism. In 1900, this policy impacted U.S. and Philippines relations and U.S. and China relations (the Boxer Rebellion in China), and in 1901 it affected U.S. and Cuban relations (the Platt Amendment). Not suprisingly, given this time perio and the aforementioned U.S. laws, the myth of the West and the myth of rodeo are tied to White westward expansion. There is a parallel etween the dangers the pioneers faced during their quest of Manifest Destiny - the hostile elements, raging rivers, outlaws, Indians - and the cowboys' dnagers faced in rodeo. Later, these same racist ideals were put on film when Thomas Dixon's book, *The Clansman* (1905), was turned into the move, *Birth of A Nation*, which was directed by D. W. Griffith in 1915. Dixon was a classmate of former President Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson had a special screening of the movie at the White House, where the Supreme Court was also in attendance. As media scholar Donald Bogle noted, the film 'would work audiences into a frenzy...[I]t will make you hate.' This movie heralded the KKK as the saviors of the White race and protectors of White womanhood and virginity from the Black male brute who was no longer controlled by the system of slavery, and increased White male membership in the terrorist organization."

"legal scholar Margaret Russell"
"through a carefully constructed fusion of unprecedented technical wizadry and degrading racial stereotypes, Griffith sought to convince his audience that his was the 'true' story of the old South and that white domination was necessary for their survival. To a great extent, he succeeded: The film's enormous popularity fueled the growing influence of the Klan, and *The Birth of a Nation* remains to this day one of the highest-grossing box office successes in Hollywood history." 

"Wister's novel went through 'fifteen printings during the first eigh months after its publication; by 1911 it was in its thirty-eight printing. By 1938, it had sold mroe than one and one-half million copies.'"
"While not everyone embraced Wister's East Coast take on the West, and while other novels later existed, *The Virginian* was considered a seminal work that cemented the myth of the White American West in the U.S. imagination, as well as of the iconic stoic, independent cowboy, who is always visually depicted as a White man."

"The American cowboy is idealized in folklore as masculine, independent, and an explore. Curiosity as a foundational element of human existence led to the stereotype of the cowboy myth, which continues to be embraced. Early explorers liek Coronado in 1541, and later Lewis and Clark in the early 1800s, said the American West was a vast open plain, a desert where one could conquer man, land, and beast. The untamed elements of the Western frontier remain static in the narrative of the West. Ideally, the American cowboy and the narrative of the Western frontier were painted with heroic myths worthy of 'god-like' worship, whereby the embellishment of the narrative outshone the lived reality of the frontier."

"The exclusionary dominance of the White cowboy as a representative of the West in rodeo depictions and as portrayed in dime novels, film, and folklore is that he is believed to be anyone: that person any White Anglo Saxon Protestant (WASP) male could become."

"He is not complicated in his white/black binary vision of the world; you are either good or bad and the judgment coms from his 'correct' attitudes, beliefs, and values, which are ideals found within the cowboy culture and code - the Code of the West. He symbolizes the possibility of what can be achieved thorugh a hard work ethic and through traditional gender roles that reinforce Victorian ideals of White womanhood, e.g., a helpless virginal damsel in distress who needs the protection and direction of a strong man to react against any transgression committed against her. Our hero in this Western White myth is complete with his leathered face and Western drawl. He is armed with is trusty six-shooter, while keeping an eye out for American Indians. '[The] Anglo-Saxon cowboy and the Red Indian emerged as convenient action heroes. These simplified stick figures propagated a frontier mythology that hid both the systemic violence of conquest and the modern incorporation of land and labor. Cowboy hats and warrior headdresses obscured the complex racial politics of the United States and created instead a ronatic duel of white against red.' From this duel of reductionist cowboy ideals, race, and land emerged an American iconic myth (the cowboy) that is actually a conglomeration of 'White conquering West' rhetoric, media fascination, and myths - like the explorations of Daniel Boone - which loomed larger than life. The myths of man besting beast carried over into the rodeo cowboy arena."

"The cowboy represents the taming of the forces of North American civliziation. In the arena, these great forces clash. The cowboy hero attempts to 'tame the wild...'"

"Wister's novel went through 'fifteen printings during the first eight months after its publication; by 1911 it was in its thirty-eight printing. By 1938, it had sold more than one and one-half million copies.'"

"the histories of the American West...[of] heroci tales: stories of adventure, exploration, and conflict."

"overcome a conflict, seek adventure, and explore new territory"

"The rodeo cowboy is only one of the numbers of modern occupational folk hero types, yet he is a fascinating one. He is, after all, a modern man - he lives in industrial America...sleeps at the Holiday Inn....[Y]et on the other hand he is a cowboy - representing facets of North America's past that evoke powerful rural and pre-industrial images. This makes for a fascinating paradox."

"The rodeo cowboy embodies two different men. On one hand, he is modern and experiences all of the modern conveniences that are available, yet he is also a man whose job it is to recreate the Wild West for entertainment. He retells an age old story of good versus evil while attempting to tame the wild, even while making a career out of being a show performer. The rodeo road for our cowboy hero has been built from a diverse history, starting with the Wild West shows."

"Amazon" - "cowgirls"

"Free fromt he confines of the corset, cowgirls were seen as powerful, as talented, and with fewer restrictions placed upon them. The transition from a Victorian Ideal in the East to a free-spirited lifestyle in the West was embraced wholeheartedly by the cowgirls in the arean;a the media and the society, however, were less willing to give up on the feminine side of cowgirls. Media stories highlighted the cowgirls' achievements, but also made sure to mention their domesticity in order to appease women in the East and all men's notions of 'true' womanhood."

"the flapper", "this new woman of the 1920s"

"a true woman was a true woman"
"the Cult of True Womanhood promoted in 'women's magazines, gift annuals, and religious literature made women hostages in their home'"
"These cultural feminists promoted the belief that '[all] women occupied the private sphere and men occupied the public domain.'"
"This belief prevailed in Western society for many years, because as 'values changed frequently...fortunes rose and fell with frightening rapidity...social and economic mobility provided instability as well as hope, one thing at least remained the same - a true woman was a true woman."
"In 1976 Barbara Welter coined the term 'The Cult of True Womanhood' to encapsulate Victorian gender ideology for women. The four cardinal virtues of the cult were piety, domesticity, and submissiveness that all 'true' women were expected to manifest in the nineteenth century."

"Annie Oakley was a 'true woman' who is credited with being the first performer to promote the 'All-American' cowgirl, which allowed her the freedom to compete athletically against men in her profession. Oakley was above criticism for her chosen profession by the 1890s. If one were to criticize her, it would be comparable to attacking a national icon, as she was able to take advantage of visual markers of White skin, long blonde hair, clothing, and a gender-conservative stance that made her a darling of White male notions of femininty. Oakley possessed monolithic cultural identity markers that contributed to White normative standards of beauty. These types of identity markers seem to belie the complexity of lived experiences for individuals. Having this nomrative standard of beauty coupled with her persona also protected her from being branded a 'floozy,' a derogatory term directed toward women in typical men's sports during this time period. She also differed from the 'New Woman' who was rallying for suffrage, education, and advancement. Although Annie Oakley was able to perform amazing feats inside the arena, she still preferred to act like a Victorian lady outside the arena." 

"'The [White and ethnic minority] cowgirl did not exist. The young women [regardless of race] did not go cavorting over the prairies astride bucking bronhco [sic]....[I]t would have seemed exceedingly immodest for a young woman to get astride a horse wearing any sort of riding habit. Any woman doing so would have been classed as a bawdy house character, and every home on the plains would have been closed to her."

"This is an interesting characterization, because being 'bawdy' typicallyr eferred to a woman's sexual nature. So a cowgirl was at risk fo being labeled as having a bawdy or sexual character for riding a horse incorrectly - not sidesaddle. Ironically, the safest way for a woman to ride a horse, astride the horse, was deemed bawdy. So, even if a cowgirl tossed the corset, she was still subject to patriarchal notions regarding her sexuality, depending upon how she sat on and rode the horse. If the White cowgirl was thought not to exist because her place was in the home, and had all of these patriarchal rules attached to her, then the erasure of the ethnic minority cowgirl was expected. Ethnic minority cowgirls had to be disenfranchised in order to make place for the 'non-existent' White cowgirl."

## [The South between Two Frontiers: Confederate Cowboys and Savage Rednecks]((https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237018811_The_South_between_Two_Frontiers_Confederate_Cowboys_and_Savage_Rednecks)) ## 
"The myth of the Frontier, which locates the birth of the American nation in its confrontation with a bordering savagery, was a national myth in western films until the 1960s. As a genre shaping the features of Americanness, the Western attracted many ex-confederates in search of political legitimacy and the western Frontier became a place of national rehabilitation for the South. When the narrative of the myth inverted in favor of the Indian in the late 1960s, freedmen replaced confederate heroes in their quest to integrate the national community on screen. The Frontier as America’s birthplace gave the South a second chance and revealed its cultural meaning for the nation. But the Frontier, in its confrontational version of the savage wars, also resonates with the myth of the Lost Cause, in which barbarous freedmen threaten white society. If Birth of a Nation was the first and last film in which Blacks were pictured as dangerous in Hollywood, this internal Frontier reappears with the cultural crisis of the 1960s, when the South becomes home to savages of a new kind, degenerate rednecks, who embody the failure of the national myth in the Western, and come to represent the endemic savagery of America revealed by My Lai and Charles Manson. The South in films wavers between two Frontiers: the Frontier of American regeneration in the Western, and the Frontier as a danger to America in the Southern."

## [Exploring Land, Settling Frontiers](http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/) ## 
"In the days before the Industrial Revolution created a middle class and wealth could be acquired through manufacturing, land for producing crops, wool, meat, and wood products was the basis of English wealth. Land was controlled by the hereditary aristocracy. Peasants had little opportunity to climb the social ladder and join the aristocracy, and little chance to become landowners with control over their own farms.

Roughly half of the population in England owned no land. No matter how hard they worked, those who did not inherit land had little expectation of acquiring it.

The English social system fractured as population grew from 3 million in 1500 to 5 million in 1650. Wealth remained sequestered in just a few families, high unemployment became common, and social unrest erupted into the English Civil War in the mid-1650's.1

An alternative to a lifetime of frustrating, never-ending poverty in England was emigration. Travel across the Atlantic Ocean was unpleasant and dangerous, and moving to the Virginia colony was a great risk. However, migration was the easiest way for many Englishmen to become landowners, and Virginia offered an opportunity for the minor gentry and even lower classes to climb into the upper ranks of wealth and power.

Speculation in land across the Atlantic Ocean spurred changes in traditional business practices in England. The Virginia Company was an early expression of a relatively new economic approach, the joint stock company. It was a legal tool where investors could pool their capital and risk, then share the rewards as a "corporation" rather than as individuals. If the speculative colonization venture failed, the investors' funds disappeared - but only those funds were put at risk, not the entire personal wealth of the investor."


"Explorers like Daniel Boone led the way for many farmers to clear the forest (or clear out the Native Americans) and get started with crops such as corn. Like Boone, not all settlers were savvy enough to retain their property, but many managed to provide a substantial inheritance to their children that would have been impossible in Europe.

The availability of so much cheap land did not guarantee that Virginia society would be more democratic than in England, and plantation agriculture based on tobacco led to slavery. The availability of labor determined how much tobacco could be produced in Virginia, while in England the amount of land owned by a farmer was the limiting factor for production."


"The concept of frontier is often confused with a bright-line boundary, an edge between two places. In descriptions of colonial Virginia, the term 'frontier' is often used from just the point of view of the English culture. Fur traders penetrated into the 'backcountry,' the territory beyond the frontier. As the colonial population expanded, Native American cultures were forced to surrender land, pushing back the 'frontier.'"

"A listening tour in Mississippi asks flag supporters why they still support a symbol that represents pain, division and difficult history"
by Donna Ladd with pictures by Kate Medley

“'Effie, it’s just been a bad day,' the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. 'I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.'

The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.

'What did he do?' Effie Luby asked.

'He raped and killed a white woman.'"

"The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.

To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called 'liberalism'; to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at 'pro-white' rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial divides."

"The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.

The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the 'lost cause' of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a **'romanticized'** version of the war’s purpose.

By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled; in front of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.)

The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, division and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it."


"'The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,' Ira says. '… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!' he says."

"'Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,' the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over 'states’ rights' to financial independence; the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset; northern tariffs were killing the south; few southerners and soldiers owned humans; slavery was fading anyway; and it wasn’t about white supremacy."

"I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept."


"By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s 'Black Republicans' adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln 'preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.'"


"Massey, who identifies as more “Blackfoot-Cherokee” than white, isn’t interested in military history, saying the flag celebrates her heritage as a southerner, period. She grew up in Red Bay, Alabama, in a former slave region that the last census showed as 93% white and 1% black.

'We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,' she says."


“'It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,' she says."


"Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an 'inanimate object,' adding: 'Stop letting it control you.'

'If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.

The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls 'just a piece of cloth'.

'It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,' Be says."


"Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.

Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.

'To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,' Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were 'dirt-poor farmers' with no slaves."


"We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells 'adult novelties' and Confederate tchotchkes.

If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room."


"Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to divide them from people with shared economic interests.

'The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial division to maintain economic control,' the NAACP president says."


"The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.

'The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,' he says. 'Enjoy.'"


"'The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,' I say as she listens intently. 'But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist. Many people were taught certain things.'"


## [Confederate Flag in Popular Culture - Americana or Racist Symbol](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/22/confederate-flag-pop-culture-harmless-americana-racist-symbol) ##

"For a long time the flag was a touchstone for everyone from Primal Scream to the Dukes of Hazzard, but the Charleston murders have brought the American south’s iconic symbol under new scrutiny.

In the pop artist Larry Rivers’s haunting 1959 painting The Last Civil War Veteran, a man lies on his death bed under the flags of both the Confederacy and the Union. It is one of a series of works in which Rivers depicts the Confederate flag as a piece of Americana, a totem of history, a pop icon. He is far from the only artist to have used it in this way.

As the flag of the old American south comes under scrutiny for being an image of – and maybe an incitement to – racism and murderous bigotry, it is worth remembering that for a long time it has had a more ambiguous, apparently innocent reputation in popular culture.

No one accused the Dukes of Hazzard of white suprematism when the good ol’ boys who had a rollicking time in the 1970s TV series flaunted the starred diagonals of the flag that has become famous as the “Confederate battle flag” on their Dodge Charger. Similarly, no one has taken issue with its appearance everywhere from a Primal Scream album cover, which used a photograph of the stars without bars by William Eggleston, to Matt Groening’s self-parodic appearance as a flag-waving, far-right propagandist in The Simpsons (the joke being that it’s the opposite of the truth).

The Confederate flag suddenly looks like a starkly, horribly political totem, but can a flag have only one meaning? It is not even completely authentic: in reality, the southern states had several flags in the civil war, and the famous image is just part of a battery of original insignia, reduced in memory to one. Back when Larry Rivers was exploring it as a pop art icon, Jasper Johns made his great image of the Union flag with layers of collaged newsprint under its wax-painted stars and bars. In Flag, Johns captures the many stories hidden within nationhood. Flags are complex documents.

It is reasonable now to wonder if the Confederate flag is pure racist imagery, but its widespread cultural use would suggest it is more complicated than that. It also raises a bigger question. Is white southern identity itself something that needs to be abandoned or condemned? The proud cultural history of the south embraces everything from Jack Daniels and country music to the novels of William Faulkner and paintings of Cy Twombly – can that cultural richness be dismissed as archaic conservative nostalgia, or worse?

In reality, the struggle between regressive prejudices and human decency in the south has long been fought within its cultural traditions, not against them. The obvious example is country music. Robert Altman’s portrayal of country as a cynical conservative style in his film Nashville now looks like a hopelessly ignorant view of a tradition that includes radical voices like Steve Earle and Townes van Zandt.

The white American south has kept some of its most pestilential prejudices intact since the civil war. But it is not racist to drink bourbon, listen to Texas outlaw music or eat crabcakes, and it may not be racist to display a flag. In the end, it is just a piece of cloth."

"Much like some claim that the religion of Islam has been distorted and misused by some radical groups so is the case with this flag. Once the symbol of a misguided attempt to form a nation of slave holding states it is now been appropriated by hate groups, anti-government types, and militia types. So just as politicians call for those in mainstream Islam to denounce those who distort its tenets than so should they call for this flag to be put away and for strong statements to be made by white Southern Baptists Church leaders of their disgust for those groups and their use of this symbol. The nation it represented was defeated both on the battlefield and by choosing a path against human dignity. The flag belongs in museum as a reminder that people can find all kinds of ways to try to legitimize oppression even forming a central government and associated banner when hypocritically speaking of states rights."


## [Confederate Railroad - Crashing Symbols](https://www.oneillinois.com/stories/2019/7/10/crashing-symbols) ##
"Two flags: one a symbol of the nascent nation, the other a symbol of the insurgent Confederacy that declared itself independent only to be dragged back into the union in the Civil War. It seems simple enough. They’re just flags, after all. What’s the offense?

They’ve both become loaded with significance, that’s what, and many Illinoisans take offense over what they’ve come to represent.

The Confederate stars and bars is a symbol of pride to many in the South, to be sure. But that raises the question, what exactly are people proud of when they display that flag? Southern resilience? A particularly Southern spirit of ornery independence? Outright rebellion? Slavery?

 It’s a loaded symbol, and to many it’s genuinely fearsome, representing not only slavery, but those who would assert white supremacy today."
 
 “The Confederate flag is a symbol of the hate, oppression, and enslavement of African Americans. It was flown over states that committed treason and started a war — so that they could keep enslaving people. Hundreds of thousands were slaughtered in this fight over whether the nation should allow slavery or end it. Abraham Lincoln’s assassin was a disciple of the Confederacy. In short, the Confederate flag symbolizes slavery and the rebellion against the United States, and it is exactly what our state’s greatest son, President Lincoln, was fighting against. This symbol of hate, oppression, and bloodshed is categorically different from political satire.”

## [150 Years Ago, The Homestead Act Transformed the West](https://www.hcn.org/wotr/how-150-years-ago-the-homestead-act-transformed-the-west) ##
"All across forests of the West, 10-by-12-foot cabins stand forlorn and forgotten, many with tumbledown roofs and gaping doors. Yet these modest homesteads represent a revolution in public-land policy: They were the culmination of an American dream born of Thomas Jefferson’s belief that at our best, we would become a nation of independent farmers.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the fruit of Jefferson’s conviction -- the 1862 Homestead Act. The federal law changed the West forever by providing a new start for urban emigrants, immigrant families and single women.

Passed by Congress in 1862, during the Civil War, the Homestead Act celebrates one of the great settlement opportunities in world history. Only a young, brawny nation like the United States would be able, or willing, to give away free land.

Congress realized Jefferson’s dream when it voted to provide 160 acres, a quarter section, of free land, for anyone willing to live on it for five years, plant crops and build a cabin 10 by 12 feet in size to “prove up” their claim. In the American West, 57 percent of homesteaders made good on their claims for 600,000 patents on 80 million acres of what had been public domain.  The lure of free land drew American emigrants in covered wagons as well as European immigrants who crossed oceans and took railroads west.

Blake Bell, historian at the Homestead National Monument of America in Nebraska, notes that the Homestead Act “transformed the United States and the world as millions of lives were forever impacted by the government’s distribution of free land.”

A remarkable feature of this uniquely American law was its openness. The law did not require that homesteaders be American citizens, or even that homesteaders be men. Any adult could take up free land in the West, and dozens of single mothers tried their hand at homesteading.

The Homestead Act became wildly popular, and over the decades different versions of the law would be passed, such as the Timber Culture Act (1873), the Desert Land Act (1877), the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, a stock-grazer’s law where ranchers could own the surface but the federal government kept the minerals, and even a special homestead law for World War I veterans. Between 1862 and 1934, when the Taylor Grazing Act greatly diminished homesteading, 4 million land grants averaging 160 acres were made in 30 states.

Of course, fraud flourished.  Conniving ranchers sent their cowboys to homestead key springs and land along creeks. Tales are told of homesteaders swearing on the Bible that they had built a 10-by-12 cabin, without admitting that it was only 10-by-12 inches. Brothers sought adjoining claims and built one cabin straddling 320 acres instead of separate cabins on 160 acres.

Most of the homesteads have long since been incorporated into larger farms or ranches. So it was exciting to find a family that still owns its ancestors’ original homestead of 160 acres, no more, no less. The land is located in the Wet Mountain Valley of Colorado, against the east side of the rugged Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

Named a Colorado Centennial Farm, it represents five generations of consecutive family ownership since Moritz and Matilde Brandenburg homesteaded the ground in 1880. Their land patent was signed by President Chester A. Arthur. Great-great-grandson John Brandenburg explained, “The ground here was like it was in Germany -- loamy soil. It was tough times to homestead. My parents almost lost the place during the Depression in the 1930s, when you couldn’t find a dollar.”

But while thousands of homestead families sold their claims and moved away, the Brandenburgs hung on. Now the land is under a conservation easement held by the San Isabel Land Protection Trust, which safeguards sweeping views of the Sangre de Cristo Range, white now with the first snows.  Brandenburg and his son, Ken, hope to keep their property in the family. As Ken says, “It’s our refuge.”

I grew up on a former homestead of 160 acres in southeast Colorado, attending high school on the High Plains, the short-grass prairie of songbirds, raptors, jackrabbits and grama grass. It was a place of vastness where I had a view as far as the eye could see.

The homesteading legacy that peopled the West endures. Though forlorn cabins, roofless against winter winds, stand empty today, those simple structures represent success for families starting fresh, thanks to the key law that settled the West."


## [The Homestead Act](Homestead Act: Primary Documents in American History) ##
"Enacted in 1862, the Homestead Act encouraged Western migration by offering settlers 160 acres of public land. This guide compiles Library of Congress digital materials, external websites, and a print bibliography."

"Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 20, 1862, the Homestead Act encouraged Western migration by providing settlers 160 acres of public land. In exchange, homesteaders paid a small filing fee and were required to complete five years of continuous residence before receiving ownership of the land. After six months of residency, homesteaders also had the option of purchasing the land from the government for $1.25 per acre. The Homestead Act led to the distribution of 80 million acres of public land by 1900."

"President Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the Homestead Act on May 20, 1862 granted Americans 160-acre plots of public land for the price a small filing fee. The Civil War-era act, considered one of the United States’ most important pieces of legislation, led to Western expansion and allowed citizens of all walks of life—including former slaves, women and immigrants—to become landowners."


"In a July 4, 1861 speech, Lincoln told the nation the purpose of America’s government was "to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial burdens from all shoulders and to give everyone an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life." He followed through with the passage of the Homestead Act, which remained active for 124 years until it was repealed in 1976, and resulted in 10 percent of U.S. land—or 270 million acres—to be claimed and settled.

The incentive to move and settled on western territory was open to all U.S. citizens, or intended citizens, and resulted in 4 million homestead claims, although 1.6 million deeds in 30 states were actually officially obtained. Montana, followed by North Dakota, Colorado and Nebraska had the most successful claims. Native Americans were forced from their lands and onto reservations to make way for homesteaders.

During a speech made in Ohio in February 1861, Lincoln said the act was “worthy of consideration, and that the wild lands of the country should be distributed so that every man should have the means and opportunity of benefiting his condition."


"Of course, there were those who took advantage of homesteading. According to the National Archives, a limited number of farmers and laborers could afford to build a farm, which included access to tools, crops, livestock and more.

“In the end, most of those who purchased land under the act came from areas quite close to their new homesteads (Iowans moved to Nebraska, Minnesotans to South Dakota, and so on),” the agency states. “Unfortunately, the act was framed so ambiguously that it seemed to invite fraud, and early modifications by Congress only compounded the problem. Most of the land went to speculators, cattlemen, miners, lumbermen, and railroads.”"


"Americans hold a certain image of the West and Great Plains: a vague concoction of pioneers in covered wagons, hardworking, honest farmers, and, of course, Little House on the Prairie. The Homestead Act (1862) garnered widespread interest in settling the U.S. West; it created the impression that anyone willing to work hard could eke out a living on their own property. Self-fashioned pioneers streamed over the prairie’s overland trails in an attempt to forge their own success on the frontier."


"Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 during the Civil War, the Homestead Act was the most comprehensive land distribution bill passed in the nineteenth century. Prior to the act, the U.S. government auctioned or sold public land in large lots that ordinary citizens could not afford to buy or manage. The Homestead Act ambitiously shifted land ownership and development towards average American citizens."


"During the Civil War Abraham Lincoln and his Republican majority passed a series of bills intended to develop the United States West, taking advantage of the fact that there was little competition after the South left Congress. These laws had been stymied during the Antebellum sectional crisis due to the issue of slavery in Western territories."


"The Homestead Act of 1862 stated that any current or future citizen, with a mere ten dollars, could claim a homestead of up to 160 acres of government land, and “improve” the land by putting it to use as a family plot. This meant erecting a dwelling and farming the soil for a period of five years. If the claimant did so for the allotted period, they could then gain ownership of their land free of charge. The act did not define what it meant to be the “head of a family,” save for an age restriction of twenty-one years if a single individual sought land, which made the Act egalitarian; it allowed African Americans, persecuted and famine-struck immigrants, and even women a chance to find freedom and success in the West. Although many of these settlers were not successful (due in part to expanding industrialization and the harsh climate of the Plains), the Homestead Act endured as the driving force for many Americans and immigrants seeking the “American dream,” as well as in exacerbating the strained relationship between the individual farmer and railroad companies who owned the majority of Western territory."


"Kansas: The Land of Promise for African Americans
In the Reconstruction South during the 1870s, volatile racism pushed former black slaves to seek refuge in the Midwest. Many took advantage of the Homestead Act as an opportunity to manage their own households through subsistence farming while forging new lives in the Midwest. The Homestead Act did not ask for an applicant’s race (it was assumed, at the time, applicants would all be white), so in order for historians to find African American homesteading family records in the National Archives, they must triangulate them with other sources."


"Exclusively Black Settlements
Several exclusively black settlements began to emerge in Kansas after the Homestead Act. The most well-known was a town called Nicodermus, established in 1877. Founded by land prospector W.R. Hill and advertised by black minister W.R. Smith to black communities throughout the south, the town steadily increased in size, and by 1880 over 100 people had settled there. As African Americans slowly became disheartened and disillusioned by the difficulty of homesteading, migration numbers tapered off. However, between the years of 1869 and 1879, 27,000 blacks moved to Kansas, and though few found the success they had been hoping for, a considerable number stayed, finding it a better alternative to the South. 10 An 1879 issue of the Topeka Colored Citizen stated: “Our advice…to the people of the South, Come West, Come to Kansas…in order that you may be free from the persecution of the rebels. If blacks come here and starve, all well. It is better to starve to death in Kansas than to be shot and killed in the South.” (24:41) In the end, the challenges of African American homesteaders mirrored those of other settlers: some persevered and stayed, while others went into debt and left, discouraged by an Act that they had hoped would bring them prosperity or, at the very least, a small pocket of land and a home to call their own."


## Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://www.history.com/topics/westward-expansion/lewis-and-clark) ##
"The Lewis and Clark Expedition began in 1804, when President Thomas Jefferson tasked Meriwether Lewis with exploring lands west of the Mississippi River that comprised the Louisiana Purchase. Lewis chose William Clark as his co-leader for the mission. The excursion lasted over two years: Along the way they confronted harsh weather, unforgiving terrain, treacherous waters, injuries, starvation, disease and both friendly and hostile Native Americans. Nevertheless, the approximately 8,000-mile journey was deemed a huge success and provided new geographic, ecological and social information about previously uncharted areas of North America."

"Most of the land Lewis and Clark surveyed was already occupied by Native Americans. In fact, the Corps encountered around 50 Native American tribes including the Shoshone, the Mandan, the Minitari, the Blackfeet, the Chinook and the Sioux.

Lewis and Clark developed a first contact protocol for meeting new tribes. They bartered goods and presented the tribe’s leader with a Jefferson Indian Peace Medal, a coin engraved with the image of Thomas Jefferson on one side and an image of two hands clasped beneath a tomahawk and a peace pipe with the inscription, “Peace and Friendship” on the other.

They also told the Indians that America owned their land and offered military protection in exchange for peace.

Some Indians had met “white men” before and were friendly and open to trade. Others were wary of Lewis and Clark and their intentions and were openly hostile, though seldom violent.

In August, Lewis and Clark held peaceful Indian councils with the Odo, near present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa, and the Yankton Sioux at present-day Yankton, South Dakota."

"They crossed through Montana and made their way to the Continental Divide via Lemhi Pass where, with Sacagawea’s help, they purchased horses from the Shoshone. While there, Sacagawea reunited with her brother Cameahwait, who hadn’t seen her since she was kidnapped."

"Lewis’ group took a shortcut north to the Great Falls of the Missouri River and explored Marias River—a tributary of the Missouri in present-day Montana—while Clark’s group, including Sacagawea and her family, went south along the Yellowstone River. The two groups planned to rendezvous where the Yellowstone and Missouri met in North Dakota."


"Lewis and Clark returned to Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1806 and shared their experiences with President Jefferson.

While they had failed to identify a coveted Northwest Passage water route across the continent, they had completed their mission of surveying the Louisiana Territory from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and did so against tremendous odds with just one death and little violence.

The Corps had traveled more than 8,000 miles, produced invaluable maps and geographical information, identified at least 120 animal specimens and 200 botanical samples and initiated peaceful relations with dozens of Native American tribes.

Both Lewis and Clark received double pay and 1,600 acres of land for their efforts. Lewis was made Governor of the Louisiana Territory and Clark was appointed Brigadier General of Militia for Louisiana Territory and a federal Indian Agent.

Clark remained well-respected and lived a successful life. Lewis, however, was not an effective governor and drank too much. He never married or had children and died in 1809 of two gunshot wounds, possibly self-inflicted. A few years later, Sacagawea died, and Clark became her children’s guardian."


## [New Frontiers: South and West](https://wwnorton.com/college/history/archive/resources/documents/ch19_01.htm) ##
"The end of the Civil War found Americans confronting two frontiers of opportunity: the devastated South and the untamed West. They were—and are—the most distinctive sections of the country, and both regions exerted a magnetic attraction for adventurers and entrepreneurs. In the postwar South, people set about rebuilding railroads, mills, stores, barns, and homes. In the process of such renewal, a strenuous debate arose over the nature of the "New South." Should it try to recreate the agrarian culture of the antebellum period? Or should it adopt the northern model of a more diversified economy and urban-industrial society? The debate was never settled completely, and as a result both viewpoints competed for attention throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. By 1900, the South remained primarily an agricultural region, but it also had developed a far-flung network of textile mills, railroad lines, and manufacturing plants.

African Americans in the former Confederacy often found themselves at the center of the economic and political debate in the "New South." By the end of the century, black leaders themselves were divided over the best course to follow. For his part, Booker T. Washington counseled southern blacks to focus on economic and educational opportunities at the expense of asserting their political and legal rights. Not so, declared W. E. B. Du Bois. He attacked Washington's "accommodationist" strategy and urged blacks to undertake a program of "ceaseless agitation" for political and social equality.

Controversy also swirled around the frenzied renewal of western settlement after the Civil War. During the century after 1865, fourteen new states were carved out of the western territories. To encourage new settlers, the federal government helped finance the construction of four transcontinental railroads, conquered and displaced the Indians, and sold public land at low prices. Propelled by a lust for land and profits, millions of Americans headed west across the Mississippi River to establish homesteads, stake out mining claims, and set up shop in the many "boom towns" cropping up across the Great Plains and in the Far West.

This postwar surge of western migration had many of the romantic qualities so often depicted in novels, films, and television. The varied landscape of prairies, rivers, deserts, and mountains was stunning. And the people who braved incredibly harsh conditions to begin new lives in the West were indeed courageous and tenacious. Cowboys and Indians, outlaws and vigilantes, farmers and herders populated the plains, while miners and trappers led nomadic lives in hills and backwoods.

But these familiar images of western life tell only part of the story. Drudgery and tragedy were as commonplace as adventure and success. Droughts, locusts, disease, tornadoes, and the erratic fluctuations of commody markets made life relentlessly precarious. The people who settled the trans-Mississippi frontier were in fact a diverse lot: they included women as well as men, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and European immigrants.

Many of the settlers were also blinded by short-sighted greed and prone to irresponsible behavior. In the process of "removing" the Indians, military forces sometimes exterminated them. By the 1890s there were only 250,000 Native Americans left in the United States. The feverish quest for quick profits also helped fuel a boom/bust economic cycle that injected a chronic instability into the society and politics of the region.

The history of the Old West is thus a much more complicated story than that conveyed through popular culture—or through the accounts of some historians. In 1893 the historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced his so-called frontier thesis. The process of taming and settling an ever-receding frontier, Turner declared, gave American culture its distinctive institutions, values, and energy. The rigors and demands of westward settlement, for example, helped implant in Americans their rugged individualism and hardihood, and such qualities helped reinforce the democratic spirit that set them apart from other peoples. "Up to our day," Turner said, "American history has been in large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development." He was both right and wrong. The frontier experience explains much about the development of American society, but not all."

## [The Wild West Meets the Southern Border](The Wild West Meets the Southern Border) ##
"The show is about to start, so we step into the O.K. Corral and find seats in the metal bleachers, among twenty or thirty spectators. The show itself goes over my head—Clantons, Earps, Clantons, Earps—but every single one of the many gunshots in the short performance makes me jump. Perhaps because I didn’t grow up in the U.S., Wild West reënactments evoke no nostalgia in me. When I ask American friends what they know about the reënactment world, most mumble something about the Civil War. Some were dragged as kids to a reënactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, which for the past twenty-five years has taken place annually at the site where the real battles were fought. Few people I come across know that there are more than fifty thousand Civil War reënactors in the country, members of a guild with strict hierarchies and distinctions. Tony Horwitz, in his book “Confederates in the Attic,” analyzes what he calls “a period rush,” the particular adrenaline-fuelled energy that comes with being fully immersed in an authentic re-creation. Authenticity is the yardstick in reënactment culture. A “farb” is a reënactor who doesn’t spend enough time or money on props and costumes. The most committed call themselves “living historians,” and the “hard-cores” among them sometimes go on spartanlike diets in order to resemble underfed nineteenth-century soldiers; others soak the buttons that they sew on their uniforms in urine, to generate just the right amount of rust."

"America was mythologizing, via tourism and pop culture, its still recent past, and there was plenty of material to work with. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, nickelodeons and dime novels had featured the “lawless towns” of the West, and stories of cowboys, saloons, gunfights, and outlaws had become part of the collective imagination. Then came television and Hollywood, to further consolidate the myths of the Wild West."

"Traywick is full of stories, a kind of Wizard of Oz of Tombstone, and the author of countless reënactment skits. He wrote the original O.K. Corral scene (and played Wyatt Earp for twenty years)."

"Traywick tells Pejk and Cantú a long story about beheadings in China and shows them pictures of decapitated men, while I browse in the bookstore. There’s a Confederate flag in the back, some Mayan masks and relics behind Traywick’s desk, a few dusty mariachi hats, many framed pictures of admirals and generals—among them Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—and a poster of Donald Trump dressed as a cowboy, with a gun under his belt, and the slogan 'Keeping America Safe Again.'"

"The mythos of the Wild West celebrates the spirit of those who sought to settle in a new land, domesticate its difficulties, and thrive. Why, I ask, is that spirit admired in some cases and condemned in others? Our Shakespeare guides protest that I’m conflating two different things. One case is 'historical' and the other is . . . not."

"Driving south, toward the border, we see no signs of crisis, no migrants, and few cars. We see a Border Patrol cam truck—a pickup with a surveillance camera mounted on a tall mast—and many commercial trucks, probably transporting commodities in and out of the country. The great paradox of the nafta agreement is that it has allowed for freer trade of merchandise across the border, and less freedom of movement for people."


"Shakespeare is in New Mexico. Tombstone, in Arizona. Both are old mining towns near the U.S.-Mexico border. They came into existence in the eighteen-seventies, during the silver strike, but soon suffered the same fate as most of the other mining towns in the region: boom, depression, abandonment, and then a strange kind of afterlife."

## [The Myth of the Cowboy](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/20/myth-of-the-cowboy) ##
"Our starting point is the fact that, in and outside Europe, the 'western' in its modern sense – that is, the myth of the cowboy – is a late variant of a very early and deep-rooted image: that of the wild west in general. Fenimore Cooper, whose popularity in Europe followed immediately upon his first publication – Victor Hugo thought he was 'the American Walter Scott' – is the most familiar version of this. Nor is he dead. Without the memory of Leatherstocking, would English punks have invented Mohican hairstyles?

The original image of the wild west, I suggest, contains two elements: the confrontation of nature and civilisation, and of freedom with social constraint. Civilisation is what threatens nature; and their move from bondage or constraint into independence, which constitutes the essence of America as a radical European ideal in the 18th and early 19th centuries, is actually what brings civilisation into the wild west and so destroys it. The plough that broke the plains is the end of the buffalo and the Indian.

In terms of literary pedigree, the invented cowboy was a late romantic creation. But in terms of social content, he had a double function: he represented the ideal of individualist freedom pushed into a sort of inescapable jail by the closing of the frontier and the coming of the big corporations. As a reviewer said of Frederic Remington's articles, illustrated by himself in 1895, the cowboy roamed 'where the American may still revel in the great red-shirted freedom which has been pushed so far to the mountain wall that it threatens soon to expire somewhere near the top'. In hindsight, the west could seem thus, as it seemed to that sentimentalist and first great star of movie westerns William S Hart, for whom the cattle and mining frontier 'to this country … means the very essence of national life … It is but a generation or so since virtually all this country was frontier. Consequently its spirit is bound up in American citizenship.' As a quantitative statement this is absurd, but its significance is symbolic. And the invented tradition of the west is entirely symbolic, inasmuch as it generalises the experience of a comparative handful of marginal people. Who, after all, cares that the total number of deaths by gunshot in all the major cattle towns put together between 1870 and 1885 – in Wichita plus Abilene plus Dodge City plus Ellsworth – was 45, or an average of 1.5 per cattle-trading season, or that local western newspapers were not filled with stories about bar-room fights, but about property values and business opportunities?

Is this Reaganite myth of the west an international tradition? I think not. In the first place because the major American medium by which the invented west was propagated has died out. The western novel, as I have suggested, is no longer an international phenomenon. The private eye has killed the Virginian. Larry McMurtry and his like, whatever their place in American literature, are virtually unknown outside their native country. As for the western movie, it was killed by TV; and the western TV series, which was probably the last genuinely international mass triumph of the invented west, became a mere adjunct to children's hour, and in turn it has faded away. Where are Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Laramie, Gunsmoke and the rest on which the kids of the 1950s thrived? The real western movie became deliberately highbrow, a carrier of social, moral and political significance in the 1950s, until it in turn collapsed under their weight as well as the advancing age of the makers and stars – of Ford and Wayne and Cooper. I'm not criticising them. On the contrary, practically all the westerns that any of us would wish to see again date from after Stagecoach (which was released in 1939). But what carried the west into the hearts and homes of five continents was not movies that aimed at winning Oscars or critical applause. What is more, once the late western movie had itself become infected by Reaganism – or by John Wayne as an ideologist – it became so American that most of the rest of the world didn't get the point, or, if it did, didn't like it.

In Britain, at least, the word 'cowboy' today has a secondary meaning, which is much more familiar than the primary meaning of a fellow in the Marlboro ads: a fellow who comes in from nowhere offering a service, such as to repair your roof, but who doesn't know what he's doing or doesn't care except about ripping you off: a 'cowboy plumber' or a 'cowboy bricklayer'. I leave you to speculate (a) how this secondary meaning derives from the Shane or John Wayne stereotype and (b) how much it reflects the reality of the Reaganite wearers of dude Stetsons in the sunbelt. I don't know when the term first appears in British usage, but certainly it was not before the mid-1960s. In this version, what a man's got to do is to fleece us and disappear into the sunset.

What was so special about cowboys? First, clearly, that they occurred in a country that was universally visible and central to the 19th-century world, of which it constituted, as it were, the utopian dimension: the living dream. Anything that happened in America seemed bigger, more extreme, more dramatic and unlimited, even when it wasn't – and of course often it was, though not in the case of the cowboys. Second, because the purely local vogue for western myth was magnified and internationalised by means of the global influence of American popular culture, the most original and creative in the industrial and urban world, and the mass media that carried it and which the US dominated. And let me observe in passing that it made its way in the world not only directly, but also indirectly, via the European intellectuals it attracted to the US, or at a distance.

This would certainly explain why cowboys are better known than vaqueros or gauchos, but not, I think, the full range of the international vibrations they set up, or used to set up. This, I suggest, is due to the in-built anarchism of American capitalism. I mean not only the anarchism of the market, but the ideal of an individual uncontrolled by any constraints of state authority. In many ways the 19th-century US was a stateless society. Compare the myths of the American and the Canadian west: the one is a myth of a Hobbesian state of nature mitigated only by individual and collective self-help: licensed or unlicensed gunmen, posses of vigilantes and occasional cavalry charges. The other is the myth of the imposition of government and public order as symbolised by the uniforms of the Canadian version of the horseman-hero, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

I don't think it was an accident that the ideal-typical cowboy hero of the classic invented west was a loner, not beholden to anyone; nor, I think, that money was not important for him. As Tom Mix put it: "I ride into a place owning my own horse, saddle and bridle. It isn't my quarrel, but I get into trouble doing the right thing for somebody else. When it's all ironed out, I never get any money reward.

In a way the loner lent himself to imaginary self-identification just because he was a loner. To be Gary Cooper at high noon or Sam Spade, you just have to imagine you are one man, whereas to be Don Corleone or Rico, let alone Hitler, you have to imagine a collective of people who follow and obey you, which is less plausible. I suggest that the cowboy, just because he was a myth of an ultra-individualist society, the only society of the bourgeois era without real pre-bourgeois roots, was an unusually effective vehicle for dreaming – which is all that most of us get in the way of unlimited opportunities. To ride alone is less implausible than to wait until that marshal's baton in your knapsack becomes reality."

## [Cowboys in Life and Legend](https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/cowboys/CBintro.htm) ##
"Etymologists trace the use of the term cowboy back to 1000 AD in Ireland. Swift used it in 1705, logically enough, to describe a boy who tends cows. Modern usage, first in hyphenated form, dates from the 1830s in Texas. Colonel John S. "Rip" Ford used the word cow-boy to describe the Texan border raider who drove off Mexican cattle during the 1830s. The term carried a tinge of wildness, of life at the fringes of law and 'civilization.' After the American Civil War, Westerners applied the term cowboy to ranch hands, rather than cattle thieves. 

The Denver Republican (October 1, 1883) observed that 'it matters not what age, if a man works on a salary and rides after the herd, he is called a 'cowboy.' A cowboy, then as now, is a man who works at least part of the year as a salaried ranch hand. Ranchers or 'cowmen' owned land and cattle; cowboys did not own land and seldom owned cattle.

The cowboy of the American West, a dashing figure in popular novels and films, was in reality a poorly paid laborer engaged in difficult, dirty, often monotonous work. During the years after the Civil War the range cattle industry spread northward from Texas. During the 1870s cowboying spread to the Southwest and the northern plains. Although some of the young men who worked on these ranches were from the northeastern states, a majority were probably southerners. Many had fought for the Confederacy. 

Cowboys branding cattle - RACE: Unlike most movie depictions, not all cowboys were white. Racial distribution varied from place-to-place. Mostly Anglo cowboys worked the Montana ranges. Further south, however, in Texas, for example, perhaps one-third of the hands may have been African-Americans or Mexican-Americans. 

Cowboys herding cattle - WORK LIFE: The Cowboy's work year centered on two big events, the roundup and the long drive. Roundups were held in the spring and often also in the fall. After cowboys had herded cattle to a central location, they branded newborn calves, castrated and dehorned older animals, and, in the spring, chose the cattle to be taken to market. 

From 1865 to 1880 at least 3.5 million cattle were driven in herds of between 1,500 and 3,000 from southern Texas to cattle towns on rail lines in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The route most frequently used was the Chisholm Trail which went to Abilene, Kansas. Working up to 20 hours a day, cowboys drove the animals from one watering place to the next. They had to guard against predators (two- and four-footed), straying cattle, and stampedes at night. For his hard and dirty work the typical cowboy earned between $25 and $40 a month. 

By about 1890 much of the range had been fenced. The westward extension of the railroads eliminated the need for the long cattle drives. The 'good old days' of epic drives and open range riding came to an end. At this point, however, dime novels wild west shows, and books such as Owen Wister's The Virginian (1902) offered the nostalgic public a stalwart, romantic cowboy hero. Although far removed from the drab truth, the image of excitement, freedom, and drama continues to dominate popular accounts of the cattle frontier. 

Cowboys bedding down for the night - VIEWS OF THE COWBOY: The cowboy generated conflicting appraisals. When observed at the end of a long trail drive, 'hellin' 'round town," cowboys attracted little praise. The Topeka Commonwealth (August 15, 1871), painted an unflattering portrait of the cowboy on a tear.

Cowboys were no paragons of virtue, as many romantics and popularizers would have it. Nor were they the uncouth barbarians of the plains described by self-anointed spokesmen of civilization and culture. Externalities--principally the law and employers--imposed restrictions that shaped their lives. But cowboys lived as much as possible by their own internal codes of conduct. The cardinal virtues for the American cowboy were to do his best and to be cheerful, courageous, uncomplaining, helpful, and chivalrous. Of course, few cowboys maintained these ideals at all times in their lives."

## [Country Music](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/country-music-pbs-ken-burns-rosanne-cash-marty-stuart-1202173799/) ##
"The actual musicians who came onto the project were also able to help bridge the gap between these facts and the lore. Country music is rife with storytelling, and it’s just natural that some stories become more important that the actual way that events happen. Songwriter Harland Howard had once said, 'Country music is three chords and the truth. In the series, Texan singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell said, 'Country music at its best is truth-telling even when it’s a big fat lie.'"

Embracing country music means to embrace the storytelling, and thus it honors the colorful yarns spun and larger-than-life figures.

I listened to Sam [Phillips] tell how he discovered Elvis. The truth was better than anything Sam ever told, but that nobody was going to go, ‘Sam, that’s not how it happened.'” said Stuart. 'One thing that I love about country music, probably more so than any other culture – maybe the blues rivals it – there are so many American folk heroes. There’s the Coal Miner’s Daughter, the Man in Black, the Red-Headed Stranger, and on and on. They didn’t become folk heroes by pure myth; the thing I love is all of those people were voted in by the people.

The origins of country music can’t ignore the black influence, and the first episode is even titled 'The Rub,' referring to the friction or rubbing between black and white America. For example, the banjo is seen as a classic country music instrument, and it was descended from the African lute that was made from gourds. 'Country music comes from the south because that’s where slavery happened,' the series says.

In the series, only a handful of black country music performers are highlighted, and the common denominator in these stories is how race became an issue in their success and how they were perceived. Of course, standouts like Charley Pride and Carolina Chocolate Drops frontwoman Rhannon Giddens have been embraced in the field, but it still feels as if inclusion is still the exception. Although the series doesn’t venture far past 1996, one wonders how it would’ve handled the importance of someone like Lil Nas X – an out and proud gay black rapper who topped the country charts with his remix of his song “Old Town Road” with Billy Ray Cyrus.

Cash acknowledges how the personal accounts can color the story, but emphasizes that some facts just cannot be ignored, even by those who’d wish otherwise.

My own experience can’t help but color what I put out there. They were very generous and had respect about wanting to see through that prism, but everybody had it through their own prism,' she said. 'Facts are facts obviously – although today we are told they’re not – but they are. Seeing those facts through how they influenced different musicians and also the cohesion of how they told the story – bringing together Appalachian music and Bob Wills and Bakersfield and the African banjo and early folk music – all were put into the piece.'

Early setbacks for black artists are given a passing mention, before the series moves on. African-American musician DeFord Bailey was the first musician to be introduced on the Grand Ole Opry radio program and its first black performer when it became a stage show. When he went on tour, many of his fellow white performers had to stick by him when he was refused service because of his race. But in 1941, during the height of the licensing wars, he refused to learn non-ASCAP songs and was promptly fired. Judge George Hay, who had first hired Bailey, wrote off his longtime colleague, saying, 'Like many of his race, he was lazy.'

Although 'Country Music' doesn’t delve much deeper to examine the everyday racism in the music and its greatest stars, the truth lies in the present day. The mingling of cultures brought about this new genre, and yet, it’s evolved to forget and exclude African Americans. Or perhaps black America has decided to leave country music behind."

## [Scandalous Saddle](https://truewestmagazine.com/the-scandalous-saddle/) ##
"Women riding aside leads to dangerous (and ridiculous) saddle invention.

Buffalo Bill’s Wild West sharpshooter Annie Oakley rode aside, as in this picture, performing '…horseback tricks from a sidesaddle, a contraption with a flat seat, on which the rider sat sideways, and a thick, leather-covered hook, which the rider used to anchor herself by her leg to the horse’s back,' wrote Glenda Riley, in The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley. She also took advantage of the sidesaddle, Riley added. When Oakley dangled off the side of her horse to pick up a hat off the ground, she appeared as if “she floated on the horse’s back.

As absurd as this may sound, the sidesaddle took hold in the 14th century to protect the virginity of a teenaged princess traveling across Europe to wed the young King of England.

Surprised? Don’t feel alone. Most assume the sidesaddle was the natural outcome of fashion, demanded by the long, flowing, sometimes over-hooped skirts favored for so many centuries.

For some 500 years, women were told the only way a 'proper lady' sat on a horse was sideways, holding on for dear life, a passenger on a 1,500-pound animal she could barely control."


"Princess Anne of Bohemia, a predecessor of the modern Czech Republic, was the daughter of the most powerful monarch in Europe in 1382 when she left for England to wed King Richard II. To ensure her virgin marriage, ruling men instructed her to ride aside, rather than astride."


"Women hadn’t always ridden so askew.

Although ancient Greek sculptures depict women riding aside, it was an option, not a demand. Joan of Arc didn’t ride into battle in the 1400s as a dainty maid. Geoffrey Chaucer depicted his 'Wife of Bath' riding astride in the 1300s. Central Asian women mounted horses like their brothers did, and Amazon women were famous for both their trousers and riding astride.

But then came Anne and the fixation on 'virtuous virgins.' Folks like to mimic royals, so the idea of a sidesaddle spread.

By 1600, riding aside was the only way a “decent” woman could ride a horse without scorn. Most women went willingly along—except for Catherine the Great, of course, who was so powerful, she decreed her court would all ride astride.

'The reins, both of personal power and individual equestrian control, had been taken away by men who now restricted a woman’s political and equestrian destinies,' CuChullaine O’Reilly wrote for the Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation."


"Sidesaddle Designs

The earliest sidesaddle design was little more than a pillow and a piece of wood that faced the woman off to the scenery on the left side of the horse. This replaced the pillion—a small padded seat where the woman rode behind a male rider. The newer saddle allowed the lady to ride alone, but still gave her no control over the animal—she sat so precariously, it’s a wonder all rides didn’t end in injury. Another rider held the reins and led her horse along; she could do little but cling to the pommel and hope she didn’t fall off. The woman was not exactly “riding” the horse; she was just sitting on it as it moved.

In the 16th century, Catherine de’ Medici is credited with inspiring a saddle that allowed the woman to face forward. In this saddle, she hooked her right leg around a pommel on the saddle and placed her left foot in a stirrup. This gave her a fighting chance to stay in the saddle and handle the reins herself. But even this saddle only allowed her to proceed slowly—any speed was dangerous.

Even some female writers agreed. As the 20th century dawned and balked, British author Alice Hayes saw the first rumblings against a sidesaddle, denouncing these 'feminine desperadoes.' Although she vehemently argued women should ride sidesaddle, she did admit that the sidesaddle’s impractical design placed women in harm’s way."

"1893 book, The Horsewoman: A Practical Guide to Side-Saddle Riding"


"By 1900, American women were split on the issue—along geographic lines. Women in the East clung to the sidesaddle as proper and necessary, while Western women saw them as impractical and dangerous. Western women were far more likely to use a horse for farm and ranch labor than their Eastern sisters, who saw the horse as a weekend entertainment.

'Not one of us would tolerate the old-fashioned sidesaddle,' said one of the record 25 women inducted into the Vaquero Riding Club, composed of expert horsemen of Spanish heritage, during the early 1900s."


“'Two-Gun' Nan Aspinwall began calling herself 'Montana Girl' in 1906, two years before she started performing with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Great Far East troupe, where she became a hit."

“Snappy Western Girl Who Rode Horse Clear Across Continent”

Death Valley Days
Sisters in the Saddle

"In 1912, Alberta Claire made her 8,000-mile solo trip from Wyoming to Oregon, down through California, across the Arizona desert and into New York City. Along the way, she declared to anyone who’d listen that she had both the right to ride astride and the right to vote.

History does not record whether or not Claire ever met New York’s Inez Milholland, though they were contemporaries. Nevertheless, these two women were sisters in the saddle.

Nobody tied politics and riding astride as did Milholland, the beautiful face of the suffrage movement.

Milholland was born into a liberal family of means in Brooklyn in 1886. She became a lawyer—turned down by Yale and Harvard because of her sex—and gave lectures throughout the nation to support women’s rights. She led suffrage marches in 1911, 1912 and 1913, while astride a white horse named Gray Dawn."


"Getting up on a high horse takes on a new meaning when you think about the public performances of women ascending hot air balloons while seated sidesaddle on her horse, as shown in this circa 1880 lithograph. The first horse sent aloft in the air flew by platform, a dream realized by fox hunter Tetu-Brissy in 1797, and the horse graduated to a balloon in 1830, thanks to English aeronaut Charles Green. — Courtesy Library of Congress"


"Western women were also making their mark as North America’s first professional female athletes—in rodeos. Not one of them considered riding sidesaddle as they put their lives on the line to entertain while on horseback."


"Strangely enough, though, one of the greatest rodeo queens got her start riding sidesaddle. In her first rodeo event, at a county fair in 1906, 13-year-old Vera McGinnis was the only rider who rode sidesaddle, in a dress, competing against much older girls. 'It so happened that the horse show judge was a bit old fashioned and frowned upon such things as girls riding clothespin-style so Vera won first prize, a gold-handled umbrella,' True West reported in 1991."

“Sidesaddles and Suffragettes, the Fight to Ride and Vote.”

“'The fall of the sidesaddle is linked to the rise of female liberty, for it was the dawning of political freedom which brought about the overdue death of this repressive equine invention,' she wrote."

## [Revisiting China’s Southern Frontiers in the Ming–Qing Periods: Editors’ Introduction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00094633.2019.1635850) ##
"In 1911, the revolution led by Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) and his associates in the Revolutionary Alliance that overthrew the Manchu Qing dynasty was a landmark event in the history of Asia. It not only founded the first republic in Asia, but also ended the imperial rule of the country in the past two millennia. In other words, the 1911 Revolution marked the transition of empire to nation-state for China. While this change was consistent with worldwide historical developments, this was by no means an easy and smooth process for the Chinese. From the early 17th century, nation-state building began in Western Europe and gradually became a main trend of history around the world in the subsequent centuries. One of the major differences between empire and nation-state was shown in its policy toward outside regions. From ancient period, Chinese rulers entertained the notion of “All under Heaven” (tianxia 天下) in describing its imperial realm. Some scholars have considered such view as the “boundless world” (wubian tianxia 無邊天下). By contrast, a nation-state is built on a clearly defined border, or with the “limited boundary” (youxian jiangjie 有限疆界).1 From another perspective, an empire usually consisted of innerland and frontier, or center-periphery regions, whereas a nation-state hopes to control, indiscriminately, all regions within its territory. The changing meaning of the term Zhongguo 中國 underscored the transition of China from an empire to a nation-state in the early twentieth century. Over the long imperial period, Zhongguo usually referred to the core area under the reigning dynasty. As such, it was rendered as the “Middle Kingdom.” But in the process of nation-building, Zhongguo began to be used, by historians in particular, to describe China as a modern state.

But the imperial legacy remained, particularly with respect to modern China’s territorial control. The Republic of China of 1911 and the subsequent People’s Republic of China founded in 1949 both inherited the Qing empire’s territory, consisting such frontier regions as Manchuria in the northeast, (Inner) Mongolia in the northwest, and Tibet in the southwest. In this issue of Chinese Studies in History, we present the studies of frontier regions in South China, including today’s Tibetan Buddhist regions in Sichuan, mountainous areas in Yunnan, and southeast coastal regions in Fujian, during the late imperial periods. Our purpose is to showcase how the Ming and Qing dynasties envisioned their territories, designed their frontier policies, and implemented them for exercising control.

The field of frontier studies was dominated by a center-periphery discourse for a long time. That is, the idea of “All under Heaven” was a dominating concept for rulers in China, regardless their ethnicity, to entertain an all-encompassing notion of their world. Meanwhile, most rulers also had a full recognition that their imperial realm was composed of various zones, differentiated by levels of cultural development and characteristics of ethnicity. In early imperial China, for example, the policymakers had already developed the “five zone” concept in perceiving their territorial and demographic composition. For each zone, they designed different policies to best exercise control, ranging, as it were, from “free reign” to “acculturation” and “pacification.” In building modern China, needless to say, the Chinese government developed markedly different ruling policies toward frontier regions. But after founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, communist leaders also established several “autonomous districts” in outside regions like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Guangxi, which remain in place today. Thus, there has been a level of historical continuity with respect to frontier policies. At the same time, we also recognize that in more recent years, Chinese leaders have made significant changes to their ruling methods of these aforementioned regions. All this, we hope, attests to the importance of the study included in this issue.

This issue is edited also because though the outward expansion through military and economic vehicles from China’s political centers was, by any measure, the basic pattern that dynasties in Chinese history took shape, the historiography on such processes has experienced dramatic change over the past decades. The idea of overwhelming imperial extension that encompasses political annexation, cultural assimilation, and economic colonization has been constantly challenged. Instead, more attention is cast on the so-called frontier dwellers who were previously deemed voiceless and had no agency in the face of imperial imposition. Such a shift is at first made possible by the discovery of local materials in the so-called frontier regions, and second, is a reflection of new scholarly interest that calls for revisiting the nature of empires with marginalized experiences. The four articles in this special issue together present how this new trend is played out in Chinese academia."


"At the risk of oversimplification, we may perhaps argue that there have occurred two “turns” in the historiography of Chinese frontier history that affected the study as a whole in recent years: the “empire turn” and the “local turn.” The “empire turn” reconsiders “frontier” not as clearly demarcated border that separates nation-states, but the utmost reach of imperial expansion. In other words, “frontier” is not a linear boundary that defines the realm of state control, but rather an open sphere of encounter, contestation, and test point of the limit of imperial power. In this way, studies on the frontiers following the “empire turn” are usually situated in the macro frameworks of transnational geopolitics or structural comparison between multiple polities. By contrast, the “local turn” usually examines frontier history at the micro level. By paying attention to specific locales or communities, scholars tend to highlight on-the-ground agency and grassroots improvization. As such, the local turn enables scholars to reconsider the center-periphery dichotomy. Indigenous voices from the frontier may reveal how the so-called peripheries conceived themselves and their domains as the center lying amid multiple outsiders from afar. Therefore, the history of frontiers should be investigated on their own terms. The notion of “center-periphery,” as a conceptual tool, tends to marginalize the frontier region’s role in state formation. While the interaction between the metropole and the frontier is not always precipitated by the former, it is often the frontier that triggers changes and bends the state apparatus to its own will."


"The rise and development of two schools reflect and influenced the aforementioned two turns in Chinese frontier history: the New Qing History school (新清史) and the Southern China school (華南學派). One must note that these are not self-appellations, but rather names given by others. Although dissents existed within both schools, scholars tend to agree on certain key points or address common questions in similar ways. The New Qing History scholars question the hegemony of Chinese materials and classic Chinese historiography. On the contrary, they rely on non-Chinese sources to reconsider the structure of Qing imperial repertoire and revisit “China” as an analytical category. Highlighting the diversity and variety within the empire, the New Qing History scholars take frontier regions as the manifestation of the Qing empire’s heterogenous imperial nature. But is the Qing unique in this regard? As indicated in Lian Ruizhi and Zhao Shiyu’s articles, the Ming empire was quite flexible as well in creating an administrative structure that allows semiautonomous secular regimes and religious communities for indigenous practices. In that case, do we see any fundamental difference between the Ming and Qing empires’ multiethnic and hierarchical imperial order? Another contribution made by the authors of this special issue is to challenge the hegemony of ethnicity. As one significant keyword in early-stage New Qing History scholarship, ethnic identification was given extensive attention to check the domination of the Sinicization discourse. However, as Chen Boyi and Hu Xiaobai point out, ethnicity was not always the parameter of the Qing empire’s frontier policy. Chen claims that approaches to restructure grassroots communities in China proper may not differ much from those in non-Han regions; religion, as indicated in Hu’s work, oftentimes transcended ethnic and linguistic boundaries and functioned as a significant variable that formed and reformed frontier landscape. The four articles on Ming–Qing China’s southern frontier demonstrate great potential to dialog with the New Qing History scholarship that so far has shed more light on the empire’s Inner Asian frontiers."
