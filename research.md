## How is History Shared? How Do We Appreciate and Share the Past? ##
English teachers define "romance" as "somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the actual and imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other."

People tell stories about the past to share what people overcome, the life lessons people learned, how people lived their lives, and how people loved.

It's great to appreciate the best parts of our nation, our families, and our past. Stories of the past teach people lessons. People can learn to express the qualities they've heard others express. People can appreciate the reality of today that has evolved from the reality of yesterday.

It's also great to learn from the dark aspects of the past.

Romanticizing the past stems from feeling like people have lost something from the past. Romanticizing the past also stems from glorifying a past that was not as pretty in reality. Aspects of the past still remain present today in new forms. Through stories, people can take up dark aspects of the past and learn from them. Also through stories, people can take up hidden realities not fully covered in traditional ones.

Sharing history helps people understand why the world is the way it is, and how our ancestors made decisions. Sharing stories from the past differs from believing that the past is better than the present in an imaginary, however.

"Intelligence": cognitive functions, "learning, reasoning, manipulating information, and identifying patterns and relationships, solving problems, recall, planning"

Even with someone with a "borderline intellectual deficit", and "no apparent deficits", there may be needs to engage "health assessment and treatment."

"People with intellectual disability": "learn and process information more slowly", have time with "money, time, and subtleties of interpersonal interactions" and "cultural nuances"


* "Usually recognizes familiar people and has strong relationships with key people in their lives."
* "Most will have little or no speech and will rely on facial expression and body language and gestures to express their needs or feelings and those interacting with and supporting them must be active and keen observers in interpreting changes in a person's demeanor or behavior"
* "Communication systems for people with this level of disability generally rely on photographs or objects to faciliate understanding, e.g. a picture of a cup, or the cup itself, may be used in conjunction with the spoken question"
* "People with severe/profound disabilities will require lifelong assistance in personal care tasks, communication, and support in accessing community facilities/services"


"Many people find the subtleties of interpersonal relationships and social rules difficult to understand (particulary as adolescents) and may inadvertently transgress social boundaries."

## [Should Music Be Used in Occupational Therapy?](https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1874468) ##
The healing power of music - many cultures, for many centuries

Music, dance therapy

"Nothing is more laden with emotional associations"
"Nothing is more capable of recreating situations"

Therapeutic modality

Disorders, psychoses

"Occupational therapy addresses the dysfunction found in a wide variety of psychiatric, developmental, and physical disorders."


## [Music & Sound Therapy](https://www.ot-innovations.com/music-sound-therapy/) ##
"Music is a very powerful sensory modulation tool! The therapeutic effects of music on the nervous system are well researched. Literature states that a 60 beat per minute pulse can help entrain healthy internal rhythms. Some important considerations before using music in the environment or during OT treatment sessions include the following: diagnosis, age, culture, environment, personal preferences, sensitivities, and personal history."

"Slower paced music with a consistent and predictable rhythm is known for having calming effects on the system, while upbeat & quick paced music is generally alerting and facilitates action/movement. Some popular examples are listed below:

Ambient music encompasses a variety of music; most common today are many of the 'relaxation tapes' widely available on the market. The purpose of these recordings is to produce a general state of relaxation.

Bach & Pachabel: These compositions are consistent and predictable, and have a pulse of approximately 50-70 beats per minute.

Mozart or Hayden: There is continuity, clarity, and order in these compositions – although they have greater changes in rhythm, time, and color than that of Baroque.

Tchaikovsky or Beethoven: Emotional and dynamic compositions known for their strong rhythms, emotional context changes, and unique sound textures which tend to stimulate the imagination."


## [Music as a Therapeutic Medium for Occupational Engagement: Implications for Occupational Therapy] ##
"Music is a meaningful occupation; a summary of current literature and the authors’ experiences regarding health and wellness benefits and potential for music as a therapeutic medium in occupational therapy practice is presented. An interview and a summary of the authors’ experiences illustrate the role for music and its benefits for occupational therapy. These benefits are described through three themes which emerged: (a) music as a means of increasing group cohesion toward common goals, (b) music as a means of increasing socialization, and (c) music as a meaningful occupation can empower individuals to enhance and embrace wellness and recovery."


## [Occupational Therapy](https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/practice/mentalhealth/focus-on-mental-health-booklet.pdf) ##
"Studies investigating the neurology of music show links between music and cognitive function. In a meta-analysis, music has been found to play a catalytic role in hippocampal-dependent temporal order learning, spatiotemporal reasoning, memory, recall, focus modulation, attention span, attention range in left neglect, sensory-motor learning, auditory verbal learning, emotional adjust- ment, motor/executive function, and psychosocial function (Thaut et al., 2009). With vast neuronal associations in the brain, the use of music in therapy can be individualized to facilitate cogni- tive remediation using the brain’s natural neuroplastic tendency. Experiencing music requires both cerebral and limbic involvement (Thaut et al., 2009). Because both regions are involved, music can be used to address the interconnectivity and communication between these brain areas without requiring verbal capability. Listening to music addresses sensory and emotional pathways, whereas playing music requires coordination, timing, proprioception, and memory."

## [Standardization in the Lumber Industry: Trade Journals, Builder's Guides and the American Home](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1555&context=hp_theses) ##
"Many of writings about the American home are directly or peripherally related to the American lumber industry. This body of written work ranges from scholarly theories, to historical analyses, to memoirs about one’s experience in their home, to technical manuals and trade journals, based upon the desired audience. Authors explore the American home from many angles: descriptions of personal home construction, urbanization, suburbanization, and industrialization in twentieth century construction. Many published works link stylistic changes in building construction to a wide range of factors: technological improvements to building materials, new appliances for in-home use, the expanding role of women in the home, and the proliferation of pattern books due to improvements in book printing and distribution. Similarly, home construction is explored through the lumber production and the home improvement industry.

Within of these genres, unifying themes emerge and develop into a cohesive whole that shapes the way Americans think about the idea of home.

The lumber industry is among the oldest manufacturing industries in America. Its expansion was fueled by growing cities and expansion into the great west. The industry focused on logging and timber production to meet the growing demands of northeastern cities. Lumbering was known for its extreme fragmentation, as forests, sawmills, and retail outlets were often owned by different entities. Additionally, logging operations and transportation of products to the mills and lumber yards were controlled by still more companies. This far-reaching supply network was slow to react to changes in demand for products. As new materials were invented, including gypsum wallboard and mass-produced millwork, lumberyards were reluctant to stock these goods as they feared this would detract from their lumber sales. Additionally, lumberyards were often located on the outskirts of town along rail spurs due to their demands for easy rail access and large spatial requirements. The intended audience of lumber distributors was also in flux during this time period: while they needed to maintain their core audience of home- building professionals, many lumber dealers recognized that marketing their products directly to consumers (or “home handymen”) could reap financial rewards. Their remote locations and limited audience also slowed their rate of change and insolated them from modernizations that were occurring elsewhere in society.

“American Dream. In The American Family Home, 1800-1960, Clifford Edward Clarke, Jr discusses the notion of the 'American Dream,' including its history and precedents. Clarke generalizes that among the middle class, homes are a symbol of upward mobility. Specific housing types begin to dominate the landscape as features of everyday life are shared by most households. Clarke also describes that competition with one’s neighbors often accompanies the notion of home ownership. Similarly, in Where We Lived: Discovering the Places We Once Called Home: The American Home from 1775 to 1840, Jake Larkin uses photographs, drawings, and documents from the Historic American Buildings Survey to reflect on the development of American home construction. Larkin’s stated goal is to depict a house as a machine for living, while taking into account what those homes mean to the individuals or families that live there. In The Evolving House: A History of the Home, Albert Farwell Bemis and John Burchard show that homes evolve over time due changing societal expectations and inhabitant requirements.

Many authors have written scholarly books on the role of American home in society. These books place the home at the center of many societal reforms, including the women’s movement and the settlement house movement. Gwendolyn Wright’s Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in America chronicles the American domestic environment as it evolves from the earliest colonial architecture through urban renewal schemes and mass-development projects. Wright links thirteen different kinds of dwellings to architectural and ideological models that play an important role in the development of American society and common culture. David Handlin’s The American Home: Architecture and Society, 1815-1915 analyzes the diverse impacts of the home on the development of early American society and 
popular culture. Handlin, an architect and teacher, begins with the Colonial period; and presents the role of Andrew Jackson Downing on the form of American homes as well as references to home in the writings of Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau. These books enrich our understanding of the home as they speak to the importance and relevance in a larger context.

## [Trucking and Automation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/20/rigged-system-rips-off-port-truckers-editorials-debates/103015290/) ##
"Many U.S. consumers care deeply about the way their products are made. Some insist on buying American; others press corporations for codes of conduct that forbid sweatshops in foreign lands.

"But what many might not know is that some highly deplorable conditions exist right here in America, in the transport of goods rather than their manufacture.

A huge volume of the nation's imports arrive by container ship in Southern California, where short-haul truckers take the merchandise to nearby rail yards or storage depots, a key step in the goods' journey to some of the nation's leading retail stores. A year-long investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that a good chunk of the port trucking industry relies heavily on a modern-day form of indentured servitude.

The abuse starts when a trucking company pressures its drivers to sign lease-to-own contracts on their tractor-trailer rigs. Often, these drivers speak little English and do not understand what they are getting into."


"Network reporter Brett Murphy documented hundreds of cases like this at Los Angeles ports since 2010, including 1,150 instances in which drivers had filed formal complaints, 140 trucking companies that had been accused by at least one driver of shorting drivers on pay, and more than 120 cases in which drivers said they worked 12 to 20 hours at a time, in violation of federal highway safety laws."


"Federal law has numerous workplace protections, but only for employees. The trucking companies at the Port of Los Angeles classify their drivers, incorrectly in many cases, as independent contractors rather than employees."


"If a category of worker is to exist outside of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other workplace protection laws, Congress needs to either delegate workplace authority to the states, or set minimum standards to protect contract workers against exploitation."


"The industry points to a study stating that drivers like being independent contractors. But the study is commissioned by the industry, uses data not available to outsiders, and includes long-haul drivers as well as the port truckers who are the subject of so much abuse."


## [Review: The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream](https://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2017/10/review-big-rig-trucking-and-decline-american-dream) ##
"Truck drivers seem to have re-entered the public consciousness in 2017—but today our understanding of the occupation is far from the freewheeling “cowboy of the highway” image of the 1970s. It’s also no longer synonymous with “Teamster” or even seen as a desirable job.

These days most talk about truckers centers on self-driving vehicles and the prospect that more than three million professional drivers will be replaced by robots. Business writers excitedly write about how this “cost-saving” technology lies just around the corner, only briefly pausing to consider the social crisis that would be created by laying off so many workers.

As a truck driver myself, I know that so much of what we do is far too complicated to be replaced by technology any time soon. We do a lot more than just hold a steering wheel. We navigate city streets and highways that are perpetually “under construction,” deal with distracted drivers who spend more time looking at their phones than at the road, maneuver impossibly narrow spaces to make deliveries, and back trailers up to dock doors, sometimes across traffic, with no room for error—and that's just what we do from the driver’s seat, not counting time for inspections, dropping and hooking, loading and unloading."


"As 27-year driver Greg Simmons says in a recent New York Times profile of long-haul truckers, “We’re throwaway people. Nobody cares about us.” Simmons says he feels trapped in an occupation that no longer provides a decent living, thanks to corporate innovations like the pay-by-mile system, which doesn’t account for all the hours drivers get stuck in traffic or wait on trailers to be loaded or unloaded, a process that often takes hours.

For truckers at the ports who move goods from ships to warehouses, the situation is even worse. An in-depth USA Today report (June 20, 2017) exposed the terrible conditions faced by immigrants driving trucks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, describing their situation as “modern-day indentured servitude.”

Many port truckers are locked into lease agreements in which a large portion of their wages goes toward their truck and vehicle maintenance. Their bosses use these leasing agreements to force drivers into punishing schedules, threatening them with losing their truck (and forfeiting all the wages paid into the truck) if they refuse to work beyond the legal maximum hours or if they get sick and can't work. They are also often misclassified as “independent contractors,” depriving drivers of basic protections like overtime compensation, family and medical leave, and unemployment insurance."


"Deregulation, beginning with President Carter and continued by Ronald Reagan, did away with the federal permit system and encouraged thousands of new carriers to enter the industry. By dramatically increasing competition, both shipping prices and wages were driven down considerably. It became more affordable for shippers to use 'truckload' shipments, where a trailer is filled exclusively with one shipper’s freight and sent directly to its destination, instead of relying on the union-dense “less than truckload” terminals to move smaller shipments."

## [Rigged](https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/rigged-forced-into-debt-worked-past-exhaustion-left-with-nothing/) ##
"Most days, the trucker would drive more than 16 hours straight hauling LG dishwashers and Kumho tires to warehouses around Los Angeles, on their way to retail stores nationwide."


"He rarely went home to his family. At night, he crawled into the back of his cab and slept in the company parking lot."


"Talavera was a modern-day indentured servant. And there are hundreds, likely thousands more, still on the road, hauling containers for trucking companies that move goods for America’s most beloved retailers, from Costco to Target to Home Depot.

These port truckers -- many of them poor immigrants who speak little English -- are responsible for moving almost half of the nation’s container imports out of Los Angeles’ ports. They don't deliver goods to stores. Instead they drive them short distances to warehouses and rail yards, one small step on their journey to a store near you.

A yearlong investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that port trucking companies in southern California have spent the past decade forcing drivers to finance their own trucks by taking on debt they could not afford. Companies then used that debt as leverage to extract forced labor and trap drivers in jobs that left them destitute.

Using the contracts, submitted as evidence in labor complaints, and shipping manifests, reporters matched the trucking companies with the most labor violations to dozens of retail brands, including Target, Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot, Hasbro, J.Crew, UPS, Goodyear, Costco, Ralph Lauren and more.

This isn’t a case of a few bad trucking companies accused of mistreating a handful of workers.

Since 2010, at least 1,150 port truck drivers have filed claims in civil court or with the California Department of Industrial Relations’ enforcement arm, known as the labor commission."


"Prominent civil rights leader Julian Bond once called California port truckers the new black tenant farmers of the post-Civil War South. Sharecroppers from that era rented farmland to make their living and regularly fell into debt to their landlords. Widespread predatory practices made it nearly impossible for the farmers to climb out.

Through lease contracts, California’s port truckers face the same kinds of challenges in ways that experts say rarely happen in the U.S. today.

You’re working to get yourself out of the debt. You just don’t see anything like that.

Reporters tried to contact owners and managers at more than 30 trucking companies. Many did not respond or declined to comment."


"Retailers don't directly hire the truckers who move their goods at the pier. They generally hire large shipping or logistics firms that line up trucking companies through a maze of subcontractors."


"Truckers at dozens of companies describe the same basic scene. They were handed a lease-to-own contract by their employer and given a choice: Sign immediately or be fired. Many drivers who spoke little English said managers gave them no time to seek legal advice or even an interpreter to read the contract

Drivers gave their old trucks – many of which they owned outright – to their company as a down payment. And just like that they were up to $100,000 in debt to their own employer. The same guys would have had a tough time qualifying for a Hyundai days earlier."


"For years, Rene Flores regularly has driven 20 hours a day, six days a week, hauling pistachios and medical equipment into the desert from the Port of Long Beach.

'If I don’t work,” Flores says, “my kids will starve.'

He keeps a log book of fake hours in the glovebox and the real one hidden beneath his seat in case of a surprise inspection."

## [Southern White Patriarchy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335328771_Southern_White_Patriarchy) ##
"The pedestal upon which southern white womanhood stands is buttressed by an equally sacred southern white masculinity characterized by a distorted notion of honor, a penchant for violence, and male righteousness and superiority. Thus, Second-Wave Feminism spurred not only a defiant anti-feminism with which many white southern men and women identified, but also a men’s rights campaign that portrayed men as victims of reverse discrimination and promoted a dominant and defensive masculinity that was very familiar to southern white audiences. This misogyny, along with a religious assertion of manhood that was popular in southern evangelical churches, provided Republicans with an opportunity to build their partisan brand among white southerners. Often masked by romanticized notions of chivalry, southern white masculinity depends upon a patriarchal system and the traditional gender roles inherent in that system. The GOP would appeal to both as it chased southern white voters throughout the Long Southern Strategy."

## [Confederate Flag](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/06/pride-and-prejudice-the-americans-who-fly-the-confederate-flag) ##
"A listening tour in Mississippi asks flag supporters why they still support a symbol that represents pain, division and difficult history"
by Donna Ladd with pictures by Kate Medley

“'Effie, it’s just been a bad day,' the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. 'I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.'

The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.

'What did he do?' Effie Luby asked.

'He raped and killed a white woman.'"


"The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.

To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called 'liberalism'; to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at 'pro-white' rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial divides."

"The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.

The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the 'lost cause' of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a **'romanticized'** version of the war’s purpose.

By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled; in front of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.)

The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, division and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it."


"'The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,' Ira says. '… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!' he says."

"'Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,' the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over 'states’ rights' to financial independence; the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset; northern tariffs were killing the south; few southerners and soldiers owned humans; slavery was fading anyway; and it wasn’t about white supremacy."

"I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept."


"By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s 'Black Republicans' adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln 'preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.'"


"Massey, who identifies as more “Blackfoot-Cherokee” than white, isn’t interested in military history, saying the flag celebrates her heritage as a southerner, period. She grew up in Red Bay, Alabama, in a former slave region that the last census showed as 93% white and 1% black.

'We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,' she says."


“'It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,' she says."


"Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an 'inanimate object,' adding: 'Stop letting it control you.'

'If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.

The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls 'just a piece of cloth'.

'It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,' Be says."


"Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.

Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.

'To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,' Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were 'dirt-poor farmers' with no slaves."


"We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells 'adult novelties' and Confederate tchotchkes.

If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room."


"Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to divide them from people with shared economic interests.

'The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial division to maintain economic control,' the NAACP president says."


"The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.

'The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,' he says. 'Enjoy.'"


"'The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,' I say as she listens intently. 'But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist. Many people were taught certain things.'"


## [Confederate Flag in Popular Culture - Americana or Racist Symbol](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/22/confederate-flag-pop-culture-harmless-americana-racist-symbol) ##

"For a long time the flag was a touchstone for everyone from Primal Scream to the Dukes of Hazzard, but the Charleston murders have brought the American south’s iconic symbol under new scrutiny.

In the pop artist Larry Rivers’s haunting 1959 painting The Last Civil War Veteran, a man lies on his death bed under the flags of both the Confederacy and the Union. It is one of a series of works in which Rivers depicts the Confederate flag as a piece of Americana, a totem of history, a pop icon. He is far from the only artist to have used it in this way.

As the flag of the old American south comes under scrutiny for being an image of – and maybe an incitement to – racism and murderous bigotry, it is worth remembering that for a long time it has had a more ambiguous, apparently innocent reputation in popular culture.

No one accused the Dukes of Hazzard of white suprematism when the good ol’ boys who had a rollicking time in the 1970s TV series flaunted the starred diagonals of the flag that has become famous as the “Confederate battle flag” on their Dodge Charger. Similarly, no one has taken issue with its appearance everywhere from a Primal Scream album cover, which used a photograph of the stars without bars by William Eggleston, to Matt Groening’s self-parodic appearance as a flag-waving, far-right propagandist in The Simpsons (the joke being that it’s the opposite of the truth).

The Confederate flag suddenly looks like a starkly, horribly political totem, but can a flag have only one meaning? It is not even completely authentic: in reality, the southern states had several flags in the civil war, and the famous image is just part of a battery of original insignia, reduced in memory to one. Back when Larry Rivers was exploring it as a pop art icon, Jasper Johns made his great image of the Union flag with layers of collaged newsprint under its wax-painted stars and bars. In Flag, Johns captures the many stories hidden within nationhood. Flags are complex documents.

It is reasonable now to wonder if the Confederate flag is pure racist imagery, but its widespread cultural use would suggest it is more complicated than that. It also raises a bigger question. Is white southern identity itself something that needs to be abandoned or condemned? The proud cultural history of the south embraces everything from Jack Daniels and country music to the novels of William Faulkner and paintings of Cy Twombly – can that cultural richness be dismissed as archaic conservative nostalgia, or worse?

In reality, the struggle between regressive prejudices and human decency in the south has long been fought within its cultural traditions, not against them. The obvious example is country music. Robert Altman’s portrayal of country as a cynical conservative style in his film Nashville now looks like a hopelessly ignorant view of a tradition that includes radical voices like Steve Earle and Townes van Zandt.

The white American south has kept some of its most pestilential prejudices intact since the civil war. But it is not racist to drink bourbon, listen to Texas outlaw music or eat crabcakes, and it may not be racist to display a flag. In the end, it is just a piece of cloth."

"Much like some claim that the religion of Islam has been distorted and misused by some radical groups so is the case with this flag. Once the symbol of a misguided attempt to form a nation of slave holding states it is now been appropriated by hate groups, anti-government types, and militia types. So just as politicians call for those in mainstream Islam to denounce those who distort its tenets than so should they call for this flag to be put away and for strong statements to be made by white Southern Baptists Church leaders of their disgust for those groups and their use of this symbol. The nation it represented was defeated both on the battlefield and by choosing a path against human dignity. The flag belongs in museum as a reminder that people can find all kinds of ways to try to legitimize oppression even forming a central government and associated banner when hypocritically speaking of states rights."


## [Confederate Railroad - Crashing Symbols](https://www.oneillinois.com/stories/2019/7/10/crashing-symbols) ##
"Two flags: one a symbol of the nascent nation, the other a symbol of the insurgent Confederacy that declared itself independent only to be dragged back into the union in the Civil War. It seems simple enough. They’re just flags, after all. What’s the offense?

They’ve both become loaded with significance, that’s what, and many Illinoisans take offense over what they’ve come to represent.

The Confederate stars and bars is a symbol of pride to many in the South, to be sure. But that raises the question, what exactly are people proud of when they display that flag? Southern resilience? A particularly Southern spirit of ornery independence? Outright rebellion? Slavery?

 It’s a loaded symbol, and to many it’s genuinely fearsome, representing not only slavery, but those who would assert white supremacy today."
 
 “The Confederate flag is a symbol of the hate, oppression, and enslavement of African Americans. It was flown over states that committed treason and started a war — so that they could keep enslaving people. Hundreds of thousands were slaughtered in this fight over whether the nation should allow slavery or end it. Abraham Lincoln’s assassin was a disciple of the Confederacy. In short, the Confederate flag symbolizes slavery and the rebellion against the United States, and it is exactly what our state’s greatest son, President Lincoln, was fighting against. This symbol of hate, oppression, and bloodshed is categorically different from political satire.”

## [New Frontiers: South and West](https://wwnorton.com/college/history/archive/resources/documents/ch19_01.htm) ##
"The end of the Civil War found Americans confronting two frontiers of opportunity: the devastated South and the untamed West. They were—and are—the most distinctive sections of the country, and both regions exerted a magnetic attraction for adventurers and entrepreneurs. In the postwar South, people set about rebuilding railroads, mills, stores, barns, and homes. In the process of such renewal, a strenuous debate arose over the nature of the "New South." Should it try to recreate the agrarian culture of the antebellum period? Or should it adopt the northern model of a more diversified economy and urban-industrial society? The debate was never settled completely, and as a result both viewpoints competed for attention throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. By 1900, the South remained primarily an agricultural region, but it also had developed a far-flung network of textile mills, railroad lines, and manufacturing plants.

African Americans in the former Confederacy often found themselves at the center of the economic and political debate in the "New South." By the end of the century, black leaders themselves were divided over the best course to follow. For his part, Booker T. Washington counseled southern blacks to focus on economic and educational opportunities at the expense of asserting their political and legal rights. Not so, declared W. E. B. Du Bois. He attacked Washington's "accommodationist" strategy and urged blacks to undertake a program of "ceaseless agitation" for political and social equality.

Controversy also swirled around the frenzied renewal of western settlement after the Civil War. During the century after 1865, fourteen new states were carved out of the western territories. To encourage new settlers, the federal government helped finance the construction of four transcontinental railroads, conquered and displaced the Indians, and sold public land at low prices. Propelled by a lust for land and profits, millions of Americans headed west across the Mississippi River to establish homesteads, stake out mining claims, and set up shop in the many "boom towns" cropping up across the Great Plains and in the Far West.

This postwar surge of western migration had many of the romantic qualities so often depicted in novels, films, and television. The varied landscape of prairies, rivers, deserts, and mountains was stunning. And the people who braved incredibly harsh conditions to begin new lives in the West were indeed courageous and tenacious. Cowboys and Indians, outlaws and vigilantes, farmers and herders populated the plains, while miners and trappers led nomadic lives in hills and backwoods.

But these familiar images of western life tell only part of the story. Drudgery and tragedy were as commonplace as adventure and success. Droughts, locusts, disease, tornadoes, and the erratic fluctuations of commody markets made life relentlessly precarious. The people who settled the trans-Mississippi frontier were in fact a diverse lot: they included women as well as men, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and European immigrants.

Many of the settlers were also blinded by short-sighted greed and prone to irresponsible behavior. In the process of "removing" the Indians, military forces sometimes exterminated them. By the 1890s there were only 250,000 Native Americans left in the United States. The feverish quest for quick profits also helped fuel a boom/bust economic cycle that injected a chronic instability into the society and politics of the region.

The history of the Old West is thus a much more complicated story than that conveyed through popular culture—or through the accounts of some historians. In 1893 the historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced his so-called frontier thesis. The process of taming and settling an ever-receding frontier, Turner declared, gave American culture its distinctive institutions, values, and energy. The rigors and demands of westward settlement, for example, helped implant in Americans their rugged individualism and hardihood, and such qualities helped reinforce the democratic spirit that set them apart from other peoples. "Up to our day," Turner said, "American history has been in large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development." He was both right and wrong. The frontier experience explains much about the development of American society, but not all."

## [The Wild West Meets the Southern Border](The Wild West Meets the Southern Border) ##
"The show is about to start, so we step into the O.K. Corral and find seats in the metal bleachers, among twenty or thirty spectators. The show itself goes over my head—Clantons, Earps, Clantons, Earps—but every single one of the many gunshots in the short performance makes me jump. Perhaps because I didn’t grow up in the U.S., Wild West reënactments evoke no nostalgia in me. When I ask American friends what they know about the reënactment world, most mumble something about the Civil War. Some were dragged as kids to a reënactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, which for the past twenty-five years has taken place annually at the site where the real battles were fought. Few people I come across know that there are more than fifty thousand Civil War reënactors in the country, members of a guild with strict hierarchies and distinctions. Tony Horwitz, in his book “Confederates in the Attic,” analyzes what he calls “a period rush,” the particular adrenaline-fuelled energy that comes with being fully immersed in an authentic re-creation. Authenticity is the yardstick in reënactment culture. A “farb” is a reënactor who doesn’t spend enough time or money on props and costumes. The most committed call themselves “living historians,” and the “hard-cores” among them sometimes go on spartanlike diets in order to resemble underfed nineteenth-century soldiers; others soak the buttons that they sew on their uniforms in urine, to generate just the right amount of rust."

"America was mythologizing, via tourism and pop culture, its still recent past, and there was plenty of material to work with. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, nickelodeons and dime novels had featured the “lawless towns” of the West, and stories of cowboys, saloons, gunfights, and outlaws had become part of the collective imagination. Then came television and Hollywood, to further consolidate the myths of the Wild West."

"Traywick is full of stories, a kind of Wizard of Oz of Tombstone, and the author of countless reënactment skits. He wrote the original O.K. Corral scene (and played Wyatt Earp for twenty years)."

"Traywick tells Pejk and Cantú a long story about beheadings in China and shows them pictures of decapitated men, while I browse in the bookstore. There’s a Confederate flag in the back, some Mayan masks and relics behind Traywick’s desk, a few dusty mariachi hats, many framed pictures of admirals and generals—among them Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—and a poster of Donald Trump dressed as a cowboy, with a gun under his belt, and the slogan 'Keeping America Safe Again.'"

"The mythos of the Wild West celebrates the spirit of those who sought to settle in a new land, domesticate its difficulties, and thrive. Why, I ask, is that spirit admired in some cases and condemned in others? Our Shakespeare guides protest that I’m conflating two different things. One case is 'historical' and the other is . . . not."

"Driving south, toward the border, we see no signs of crisis, no migrants, and few cars. We see a Border Patrol cam truck—a pickup with a surveillance camera mounted on a tall mast—and many commercial trucks, probably transporting commodities in and out of the country. The great paradox of the nafta agreement is that it has allowed for freer trade of merchandise across the border, and less freedom of movement for people."


"Shakespeare is in New Mexico. Tombstone, in Arizona. Both are old mining towns near the U.S.-Mexico border. They came into existence in the eighteen-seventies, during the silver strike, but soon suffered the same fate as most of the other mining towns in the region: boom, depression, abandonment, and then a strange kind of afterlife."

## [The Myth of the Cowboy](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/20/myth-of-the-cowboy) ##
"Our starting point is the fact that, in and outside Europe, the 'western' in its modern sense – that is, the myth of the cowboy – is a late variant of a very early and deep-rooted image: that of the wild west in general. Fenimore Cooper, whose popularity in Europe followed immediately upon his first publication – Victor Hugo thought he was 'the American Walter Scott' – is the most familiar version of this. Nor is he dead. Without the memory of Leatherstocking, would English punks have invented Mohican hairstyles?

The original image of the wild west, I suggest, contains two elements: the confrontation of nature and civilisation, and of freedom with social constraint. Civilisation is what threatens nature; and their move from bondage or constraint into independence, which constitutes the essence of America as a radical European ideal in the 18th and early 19th centuries, is actually what brings civilisation into the wild west and so destroys it. The plough that broke the plains is the end of the buffalo and the Indian.

In terms of literary pedigree, the invented cowboy was a late romantic creation. But in terms of social content, he had a double function: he represented the ideal of individualist freedom pushed into a sort of inescapable jail by the closing of the frontier and the coming of the big corporations. As a reviewer said of Frederic Remington's articles, illustrated by himself in 1895, the cowboy roamed 'where the American may still revel in the great red-shirted freedom which has been pushed so far to the mountain wall that it threatens soon to expire somewhere near the top'. In hindsight, the west could seem thus, as it seemed to that sentimentalist and first great star of movie westerns William S Hart, for whom the cattle and mining frontier 'to this country … means the very essence of national life … It is but a generation or so since virtually all this country was frontier. Consequently its spirit is bound up in American citizenship.' As a quantitative statement this is absurd, but its significance is symbolic. And the invented tradition of the west is entirely symbolic, inasmuch as it generalises the experience of a comparative handful of marginal people. Who, after all, cares that the total number of deaths by gunshot in all the major cattle towns put together between 1870 and 1885 – in Wichita plus Abilene plus Dodge City plus Ellsworth – was 45, or an average of 1.5 per cattle-trading season, or that local western newspapers were not filled with stories about bar-room fights, but about property values and business opportunities?

Is this Reaganite myth of the west an international tradition? I think not. In the first place because the major American medium by which the invented west was propagated has died out. The western novel, as I have suggested, is no longer an international phenomenon. The private eye has killed the Virginian. Larry McMurtry and his like, whatever their place in American literature, are virtually unknown outside their native country. As for the western movie, it was killed by TV; and the western TV series, which was probably the last genuinely international mass triumph of the invented west, became a mere adjunct to children's hour, and in turn it has faded away. Where are Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Laramie, Gunsmoke and the rest on which the kids of the 1950s thrived? The real western movie became deliberately highbrow, a carrier of social, moral and political significance in the 1950s, until it in turn collapsed under their weight as well as the advancing age of the makers and stars – of Ford and Wayne and Cooper. I'm not criticising them. On the contrary, practically all the westerns that any of us would wish to see again date from after Stagecoach (which was released in 1939). But what carried the west into the hearts and homes of five continents was not movies that aimed at winning Oscars or critical applause. What is more, once the late western movie had itself become infected by Reaganism – or by John Wayne as an ideologist – it became so American that most of the rest of the world didn't get the point, or, if it did, didn't like it.

In Britain, at least, the word 'cowboy' today has a secondary meaning, which is much more familiar than the primary meaning of a fellow in the Marlboro ads: a fellow who comes in from nowhere offering a service, such as to repair your roof, but who doesn't know what he's doing or doesn't care except about ripping you off: a 'cowboy plumber' or a 'cowboy bricklayer'. I leave you to speculate (a) how this secondary meaning derives from the Shane or John Wayne stereotype and (b) how much it reflects the reality of the Reaganite wearers of dude Stetsons in the sunbelt. I don't know when the term first appears in British usage, but certainly it was not before the mid-1960s. In this version, what a man's got to do is to fleece us and disappear into the sunset.

What was so special about cowboys? First, clearly, that they occurred in a country that was universally visible and central to the 19th-century world, of which it constituted, as it were, the utopian dimension: the living dream. Anything that happened in America seemed bigger, more extreme, more dramatic and unlimited, even when it wasn't – and of course often it was, though not in the case of the cowboys. Second, because the purely local vogue for western myth was magnified and internationalised by means of the global influence of American popular culture, the most original and creative in the industrial and urban world, and the mass media that carried it and which the US dominated. And let me observe in passing that it made its way in the world not only directly, but also indirectly, via the European intellectuals it attracted to the US, or at a distance.

This would certainly explain why cowboys are better known than vaqueros or gauchos, but not, I think, the full range of the international vibrations they set up, or used to set up. This, I suggest, is due to the in-built anarchism of American capitalism. I mean not only the anarchism of the market, but the ideal of an individual uncontrolled by any constraints of state authority. In many ways the 19th-century US was a stateless society. Compare the myths of the American and the Canadian west: the one is a myth of a Hobbesian state of nature mitigated only by individual and collective self-help: licensed or unlicensed gunmen, posses of vigilantes and occasional cavalry charges. The other is the myth of the imposition of government and public order as symbolised by the uniforms of the Canadian version of the horseman-hero, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

I don't think it was an accident that the ideal-typical cowboy hero of the classic invented west was a loner, not beholden to anyone; nor, I think, that money was not important for him. As Tom Mix put it: "I ride into a place owning my own horse, saddle and bridle. It isn't my quarrel, but I get into trouble doing the right thing for somebody else. When it's all ironed out, I never get any money reward.

In a way the loner lent himself to imaginary self-identification just because he was a loner. To be Gary Cooper at high noon or Sam Spade, you just have to imagine you are one man, whereas to be Don Corleone or Rico, let alone Hitler, you have to imagine a collective of people who follow and obey you, which is less plausible. I suggest that the cowboy, just because he was a myth of an ultra-individualist society, the only society of the bourgeois era without real pre-bourgeois roots, was an unusually effective vehicle for dreaming – which is all that most of us get in the way of unlimited opportunities. To ride alone is less implausible than to wait until that marshal's baton in your knapsack becomes reality."

## [Cowboys in Life and Legend](https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/cowboys/CBintro.htm) ##
"Etymologists trace the use of the term cowboy back to 1000 AD in Ireland. Swift used it in 1705, logically enough, to describe a boy who tends cows. Modern usage, first in hyphenated form, dates from the 1830s in Texas. Colonel John S. "Rip" Ford used the word cow-boy to describe the Texan border raider who drove off Mexican cattle during the 1830s. The term carried a tinge of wildness, of life at the fringes of law and 'civilization.' After the American Civil War, Westerners applied the term cowboy to ranch hands, rather than cattle thieves. 

The Denver Republican (October 1, 1883) observed that 'it matters not what age, if a man works on a salary and rides after the herd, he is called a 'cowboy.' A cowboy, then as now, is a man who works at least part of the year as a salaried ranch hand. Ranchers or 'cowmen' owned land and cattle; cowboys did not own land and seldom owned cattle.

The cowboy of the American West, a dashing figure in popular novels and films, was in reality a poorly paid laborer engaged in difficult, dirty, often monotonous work. During the years after the Civil War the range cattle industry spread northward from Texas. During the 1870s cowboying spread to the Southwest and the northern plains. Although some of the young men who worked on these ranches were from the northeastern states, a majority were probably southerners. Many had fought for the Confederacy. 

Cowboys branding cattle - RACE: Unlike most movie depictions, not all cowboys were white. Racial distribution varied from place-to-place. Mostly Anglo cowboys worked the Montana ranges. Further south, however, in Texas, for example, perhaps one-third of the hands may have been African-Americans or Mexican-Americans. 

Cowboys herding cattle - WORK LIFE: The Cowboy's work year centered on two big events, the roundup and the long drive. Roundups were held in the spring and often also in the fall. After cowboys had herded cattle to a central location, they branded newborn calves, castrated and dehorned older animals, and, in the spring, chose the cattle to be taken to market. 

From 1865 to 1880 at least 3.5 million cattle were driven in herds of between 1,500 and 3,000 from southern Texas to cattle towns on rail lines in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The route most frequently used was the Chisholm Trail which went to Abilene, Kansas. Working up to 20 hours a day, cowboys drove the animals from one watering place to the next. They had to guard against predators (two- and four-footed), straying cattle, and stampedes at night. For his hard and dirty work the typical cowboy earned between $25 and $40 a month. 

By about 1890 much of the range had been fenced. The westward extension of the railroads eliminated the need for the long cattle drives. The 'good old days' of epic drives and open range riding came to an end. At this point, however, dime novels wild west shows, and books such as Owen Wister's The Virginian (1902) offered the nostalgic public a stalwart, romantic cowboy hero. Although far removed from the drab truth, the image of excitement, freedom, and drama continues to dominate popular accounts of the cattle frontier. 

Cowboys bedding down for the night - VIEWS OF THE COWBOY: The cowboy generated conflicting appraisals. When observed at the end of a long trail drive, 'hellin' 'round town," cowboys attracted little praise. The Topeka Commonwealth (August 15, 1871), painted an unflattering portrait of the cowboy on a tear.

Cowboys were no paragons of virtue, as many romantics and popularizers would have it. Nor were they the uncouth barbarians of the plains described by self-anointed spokesmen of civilization and culture. Externalities--principally the law and employers--imposed restrictions that shaped their lives. But cowboys lived as much as possible by their own internal codes of conduct. The cardinal virtues for the American cowboy were to do his best and to be cheerful, courageous, uncomplaining, helpful, and chivalrous. Of course, few cowboys maintained these ideals at all times in their lives."

## [Country Music](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/country-music-pbs-ken-burns-rosanne-cash-marty-stuart-1202173799/) ##
"The actual musicians who came onto the project were also able to help bridge the gap between these facts and the lore. Country music is rife with storytelling, and it’s just natural that some stories become more important that the actual way that events happen. Songwriter Harland Howard had once said, 'Country music is three chords and the truth. In the series, Texan singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell said, 'Country music at its best is truth-telling even when it’s a big fat lie.'"

Embracing country music means to embrace the storytelling, and thus it honors the colorful yarns spun and larger-than-life figures.

I listened to Sam [Phillips] tell how he discovered Elvis. The truth was better than anything Sam ever told, but that nobody was going to go, ‘Sam, that’s not how it happened.'” said Stuart. 'One thing that I love about country music, probably more so than any other culture – maybe the blues rivals it – there are so many American folk heroes. There’s the Coal Miner’s Daughter, the Man in Black, the Red-Headed Stranger, and on and on. They didn’t become folk heroes by pure myth; the thing I love is all of those people were voted in by the people.

The origins of country music can’t ignore the black influence, and the first episode is even titled 'The Rub,' referring to the friction or rubbing between black and white America. For example, the banjo is seen as a classic country music instrument, and it was descended from the African lute that was made from gourds. 'Country music comes from the south because that’s where slavery happened,' the series says.

In the series, only a handful of black country music performers are highlighted, and the common denominator in these stories is how race became an issue in their success and how they were perceived. Of course, standouts like Charley Pride and Carolina Chocolate Drops frontwoman Rhannon Giddens have been embraced in the field, but it still feels as if inclusion is still the exception. Although the series doesn’t venture far past 1996, one wonders how it would’ve handled the importance of someone like Lil Nas X – an out and proud gay black rapper who topped the country charts with his remix of his song “Old Town Road” with Billy Ray Cyrus.

Cash acknowledges how the personal accounts can color the story, but emphasizes that some facts just cannot be ignored, even by those who’d wish otherwise.

My own experience can’t help but color what I put out there. They were very generous and had respect about wanting to see through that prism, but everybody had it through their own prism,' she said. 'Facts are facts obviously – although today we are told they’re not – but they are. Seeing those facts through how they influenced different musicians and also the cohesion of how they told the story – bringing together Appalachian music and Bob Wills and Bakersfield and the African banjo and early folk music – all were put into the piece.'

Early setbacks for black artists are given a passing mention, before the series moves on. African-American musician DeFord Bailey was the first musician to be introduced on the Grand Ole Opry radio program and its first black performer when it became a stage show. When he went on tour, many of his fellow white performers had to stick by him when he was refused service because of his race. But in 1941, during the height of the licensing wars, he refused to learn non-ASCAP songs and was promptly fired. Judge George Hay, who had first hired Bailey, wrote off his longtime colleague, saying, 'Like many of his race, he was lazy.'

Although 'Country Music' doesn’t delve much deeper to examine the everyday racism in the music and its greatest stars, the truth lies in the present day. The mingling of cultures brought about this new genre, and yet, it’s evolved to forget and exclude African Americans. Or perhaps black America has decided to leave country music behind."

Buffalo Bill’s Wild West sharpshooter Annie Oakley rode aside, as in this picture, performing '…horseback tricks from a sidesaddle, a contraption with a flat seat, on which the rider sat sideways, and a thick, leather-covered hook, which the rider used to anchor herself by her leg to the horse’s back,' wrote Glenda Riley, in The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley. She also took advantage of the sidesaddle, Riley added. When Oakley dangled off the side of her horse to pick up a hat off the ground, she appeared as if “she floated on the horse’s back.

As absurd as this may sound, the sidesaddle took hold in the 14th century to protect the virginity of a teenaged princess traveling across Europe to wed the young King of England.

Surprised? Don’t feel alone. Most assume the sidesaddle was the natural outcome of fashion, demanded by the long, flowing, sometimes over-hooped skirts favored for so many centuries.

For some 500 years, women were told the only way a 'proper lady' sat on a horse was sideways, holding on for dear life, a passenger on a 1,500-pound animal she could barely control."


"Princess Anne of Bohemia, a predecessor of the modern Czech Republic, was the daughter of the most powerful monarch in Europe in 1382 when she left for England to wed King Richard II. To ensure her virgin marriage, ruling men instructed her to ride aside, rather than astride."


"Women hadn’t always ridden so askew.

Although ancient Greek sculptures depict women riding aside, it was an option, not a demand. Joan of Arc didn’t ride into battle in the 1400s as a dainty maid. Geoffrey Chaucer depicted his 'Wife of Bath' riding astride in the 1300s. Central Asian women mounted horses like their brothers did, and Amazon women were famous for both their trousers and riding astride.

But then came Anne and the fixation on 'virtuous virgins.' Folks like to mimic royals, so the idea of a sidesaddle spread.

By 1600, riding aside was the only way a “decent” woman could ride a horse without scorn. Most women went willingly along—except for Catherine the Great, of course, who was so powerful, she decreed her court would all ride astride.

'The reins, both of personal power and individual equestrian control, had been taken away by men who now restricted a woman’s political and equestrian destinies,' CuChullaine O’Reilly wrote for the Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation."


"Sidesaddle Designs

The earliest sidesaddle design was little more than a pillow and a piece of wood that faced the woman off to the scenery on the left side of the horse. This replaced the pillion—a small padded seat where the woman rode behind a male rider. The newer saddle allowed the lady to ride alone, but still gave her no control over the animal—she sat so precariously, it’s a wonder all rides didn’t end in injury. Another rider held the reins and led her horse along; she could do little but cling to the pommel and hope she didn’t fall off. The woman was not exactly “riding” the horse; she was just sitting on it as it moved.

In the 16th century, Catherine de’ Medici is credited with inspiring a saddle that allowed the woman to face forward. In this saddle, she hooked her right leg around a pommel on the saddle and placed her left foot in a stirrup. This gave her a fighting chance to stay in the saddle and handle the reins herself. But even this saddle only allowed her to proceed slowly—any speed was dangerous.

Even some female writers agreed. As the 20th century dawned and balked, British author Alice Hayes saw the first rumblings against a sidesaddle, denouncing these 'feminine desperadoes.' Although she vehemently argued women should ride sidesaddle, she did admit that the sidesaddle’s impractical design placed women in harm’s way."

"By 1900, American women were split on the issue—along geographic lines. Women in the East clung to the sidesaddle as proper and necessary, while Western women saw them as impractical and dangerous. Western women were far more likely to use a horse for farm and ranch labor than their Eastern sisters, who saw the horse as a weekend entertainment.

'Not one of us would tolerate the old-fashioned sidesaddle,' said one of the record 25 women inducted into the Vaquero Riding Club, composed of expert horsemen of Spanish heritage, during the early 1900s."


“'Two-Gun' Nan Aspinwall began calling herself 'Montana Girl' in 1906, two years before she started performing with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Great Far East troupe, where she became a hit."

Sisters in the Saddle

"In 1912, Alberta Claire made her 8,000-mile solo trip from Wyoming to Oregon, down through California, across the Arizona desert and into New York City. Along the way, she declared to anyone who’d listen that she had both the right to ride astride and the right to vote.

History does not record whether or not Claire ever met New York’s Inez Milholland, though they were contemporaries. Nevertheless, these two women were sisters in the saddle.

Nobody tied politics and riding astride as did Milholland, the beautiful face of the suffrage movement.

Milholland was born into a liberal family of means in Brooklyn in 1886. She became a lawyer—turned down by Yale and Harvard because of her sex—and gave lectures throughout the nation to support women’s rights. She led suffrage marches in 1911, 1912 and 1913, while astride a white horse named Gray Dawn."


"Getting up on a high horse takes on a new meaning when you think about the public performances of women ascending hot air balloons while seated sidesaddle on her horse, as shown in this circa 1880 lithograph. The first horse sent aloft in the air flew by platform, a dream realized by fox hunter Tetu-Brissy in 1797, and the horse graduated to a balloon in 1830, thanks to English aeronaut Charles Green. — Courtesy Library of Congress"


"Western women were also making their mark as North America’s first professional female athletes—in rodeos. Not one of them considered riding sidesaddle as they put their lives on the line to entertain while on horseback."


"Strangely enough, though, one of the greatest rodeo queens got her start riding sidesaddle. In her first rodeo event, at a county fair in 1906, 13-year-old Vera McGinnis was the only rider who rode sidesaddle, in a dress, competing against much older girls. 'It so happened that the horse show judge was a bit old fashioned and frowned upon such things as girls riding clothespin-style so Vera won first prize, a gold-handled umbrella,' True West reported in 1991."

“Sidesaddles and Suffragettes, the Fight to Ride and Vote.”

“'The fall of the sidesaddle is linked to the rise of female liberty, for it was the dawning of political freedom which brought about the overdue death of this repressive equine invention,' she wrote."
