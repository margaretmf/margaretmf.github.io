## How is History Shared? How Do We Appreciate and Share the Past? ##
English teachers define "romance" as "somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the actual and imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other."

People tell stories about the past to share what people overcome, the life lessons people learned, how people lived their lives, and how people loved.

It's great to appreciate the best parts of our nation, our families, and our past. Stories of the past teach people lessons. People can learn to express the qualities they've heard others express. People can appreciate the reality of today that has evolved from the reality of yesterday.

It's also great to learn from the dark aspects of the past.

Romanticizing the past stems from feeling like people have lost something from the past. Romanticizing the past also stems from glorifying a past that was not as pretty in reality. Aspects of the past still remain present today in new forms. Through stories, people can take up dark aspects of the past and learn from them. Also through stories, people can take up hidden realities not fully covered in traditional ones.

Sharing history helps people understand why the world is the way it is, and how our ancestors made decisions. Sharing stories from the past differs from believing that the past is better than the present in an imaginary, however.

## [Occupational Therapists: What Do They Do?](https://childmind.org/article/occupational-therapists-what-do-they-do/) ##
"Occupational therapy, known as OT, is designed to help children and adults acquire (or regain) the skills needed to perform the activities—or 'occupations'—of daily life. 'It’s a huge field,' says Lindsey Biel, an OT specializing in pediatrics and coauthor with Nancy Peske of Raising a Sensory Smart Child. When a child shows delays in mastering typical activities, or displays unusual or disruptive behavior, the OT is often the first professional to work with her.

OTs are found in many settings. Children up to age 3 may receive home-based therapy under EI. Some OTs, like Biel, are private service providers, visiting their young clients at home or in school. Others offer therapy in private sensory gyms. But, Biel says, the majority of OTs are found in schools, both pushing into classes to work with kids and pulling them out for one-on-one work on fine and gross motor skills, along with sensory gym time.

These master’s level health-care professionals take a holistic approach to a client’s physical well-being, explains the American Occupational Therapy Association, by also considering psychological, social and environmental factors that may affect functioning.

Biel explains that during an evaluation, the therapist uses a task analysis to figure out just what’s going on. Say a 5-year-old girl isn’t putting on her shoes. Is the issue sensory-based? Fine motor? Or maybe she just likes all the attention she gets from Mommy? What about a kindergartner who is still in pull-ups? 'Is it because the potty’s scary?' Biel asks. 'Do dangling feet make him feel like he’s falling, or is his tush uncomfortable? We also look at what muscle groups need to be recruited effectively to go to the bathroom.'

Biel breaks down a litany of issues OTs address on her site Sensory Smarts: attention span and arousal level; sensory and processing skills; fine and gross motor skills; activities of daily living (ADLs), also known as self-help skills, such as brushing teeth, dressing and toilet training; visual-perceptual skills; handwriting; and assistive technology.

What are sensory processing issues?
When it comes to attention, arousal level, and sensory and processing skills, the work OTs do is based on theories presented by occupational therapist Dr. A. Jean Ayres back in the 1970s. She posited that children and adults with sensory processing issues can’t synthesize all the information streaming in from the traditional five senses—touch, hearing, taste, smell and sight—as well as two “internal” senses, body awareness (proprioception) and movement (vestibular). Proprioception allows for motor control and posture, while vestibular receptors tell the brain where the body is in space, which links directly to balance and coordination. (Peske has made a short, fun video that introduces these seven senses.)

Children who have trouble modulating sensory input may experience over-sensitivity (hypersensitivity), under-sensitivity (hyposensitivity) or both to an impairing or overwhelming degree, at school, at home and in the world at large.

An extremely hypersensitive child tends to be withdrawn; because she’s easily overwhelmed by auditory and visual stimuli, she may want to avoid gym, recess and lunch. The buzz of fluorescent lights and anxiety about the loud fire alarm going off may distract her, making it difficult to pay attention and participate in class.

Controversy continues as to whether two widely used practices, joint compressions and a brushing of the skin, actually 'rewire' the brain so that kids can appropriately integrate and respond to sensory input, allowing them to feel more comfortable and secure as they negotiate their environment. Even Biel admits that she isn’t always sure these practices have merit but “just when I have my doubts, there’s this great intervention. I had a child making almost no eye contact who was constantly in motion. I put him on cushions and gave him a good brushing. I got eye contact through the whole session; his parents were gasping. Is he cured? No. Was it organizing? Yes.”

Even with someone with a "borderline intellectual deficit", and "no apparent deficits", there may be needs to engage "health assessment and treatment."

"People with intellectual disability": "learn and process information more slowly", have time with "money, time, and subtleties of interpersonal interactions" and "cultural nuances"


* "Usually recognizes familiar people and has strong relationships with key people in their lives."
* "Most will have little or no speech and will rely on facial expression and body language and gestures to express their needs or feelings and those interacting with and supporting them must be active and keen observers in interpreting changes in a person's demeanor or behavior"
* "Communication systems for people with this level of disability generally rely on photographs or objects to faciliate understanding, e.g. a picture of a cup, or the cup itself, may be used in conjunction with the spoken question"
* "People with severe/profound disabilities will require lifelong assistance in personal care tasks, communication, and support in accessing community facilities/services"

## [Should Music Be Used in Occupational Therapy?](https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1874468) ##
The healing power of music - many cultures, for many centuries

Music, dance therapy

"Nothing is more laden with emotional associations"
"Nothing is more capable of recreating situations"

Therapeutic modality

Disorders, psychoses

"Occupational therapy addresses the dysfunction found in a wide variety of psychiatric, developmental, and physical disorders."


## [Music & Sound Therapy](https://www.ot-innovations.com/music-sound-therapy/) ##
"Music is a very powerful sensory modulation tool! The therapeutic effects of music on the nervous system are well researched. Literature states that a 60 beat per minute pulse can help entrain healthy internal rhythms. Some important considerations before using music in the environment or during OT treatment sessions include the following: diagnosis, age, culture, environment, personal preferences, sensitivities, and personal history."

"Slower paced music with a consistent and predictable rhythm is known for having calming effects on the system, while upbeat & quick paced music is generally alerting and facilitates action/movement. Some popular examples are listed below:

Ambient music encompasses a variety of music; most common today are many of the 'relaxation tapes' widely available on the market. The purpose of these recordings is to produce a general state of relaxation.

Bach & Pachabel: These compositions are consistent and predictable, and have a pulse of approximately 50-70 beats per minute.

Mozart or Hayden: There is continuity, clarity, and order in these compositions – although they have greater changes in rhythm, time, and color than that of Baroque.

Tchaikovsky or Beethoven: Emotional and dynamic compositions known for their strong rhythms, emotional context changes, and unique sound textures which tend to stimulate the imagination."


## [Music as a Therapeutic Medium for Occupational Engagement: Implications for Occupational Therapy] ##
"Music is a meaningful occupation; a summary of current literature and the authors’ experiences regarding health and wellness benefits and potential for music as a therapeutic medium in occupational therapy practice is presented. An interview and a summary of the authors’ experiences illustrate the role for music and its benefits for occupational therapy. These benefits are described through three themes which emerged: (a) music as a means of increasing group cohesion toward common goals, (b) music as a means of increasing socialization, and (c) music as a meaningful occupation can empower individuals to enhance and embrace wellness and recovery."


## [Occupational Therapy](https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/practice/mentalhealth/focus-on-mental-health-booklet.pdf) ##
"Studies investigating the neurology of music show links between music and cognitive function. In a meta-analysis, music has been found to play a catalytic role in hippocampal-dependent temporal order learning, spatiotemporal reasoning, memory, recall, focus modulation, attention span, attention range in left neglect, sensory-motor learning, auditory verbal learning, emotional adjust- ment, motor/executive function, and psychosocial function (Thaut et al., 2009). With vast neuronal associations in the brain, the use of music in therapy can be individualized to facilitate cogni- tive remediation using the brain’s natural neuroplastic tendency. Experiencing music requires both cerebral and limbic involvement (Thaut et al., 2009). Because both regions are involved, music can be used to address the interconnectivity and communication between these brain areas without requiring verbal capability. Listening to music addresses sensory and emotional pathways, whereas playing music requires coordination, timing, proprioception, and memory."

## [Standardization in the Lumber Industry: Trade Journals, Builder's Guides and the American Home](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1555&context=hp_theses) ##
"Many of writings about the American home are directly or peripherally related to the American lumber industry. This body of written work ranges from scholarly theories, to historical analyses, to memoirs about one’s experience in their home, to technical manuals and trade journals, based upon the desired audience. Authors explore the American home from many angles: descriptions of personal home construction, urbanization, suburbanization, and industrialization in twentieth century construction. Many published works link stylistic changes in building construction to a wide range of factors: technological improvements to building materials, new appliances for in-home use, the expanding role of women in the home, and the proliferation of pattern books due to improvements in book printing and distribution. Similarly, home construction is explored through the lumber production and the home improvement industry.

Within of these genres, unifying themes emerge and develop into a cohesive whole that shapes the way Americans think about the idea of home.

The lumber industry is among the oldest manufacturing industries in America. Its expansion was fueled by growing cities and expansion into the great west. The industry focused on logging and timber production to meet the growing demands of northeastern cities. Lumbering was known for its extreme fragmentation, as forests, sawmills, and retail outlets were often owned by different entities. Additionally, logging operations and transportation of products to the mills and lumber yards were controlled by still more companies. This far-reaching supply network was slow to react to changes in demand for products. As new materials were invented, including gypsum wallboard and mass-produced millwork, lumberyards were reluctant to stock these goods as they feared this would detract from their lumber sales. Additionally, lumberyards were often located on the outskirts of town along rail spurs due to their demands for easy rail access and large spatial requirements. The intended audience of lumber distributors was also in flux during this time period: while they needed to maintain their core audience of home- building professionals, many lumber dealers recognized that marketing their products directly to consumers (or “home handymen”) could reap financial rewards. Their remote locations and limited audience also slowed their rate of change and insolated them from modernizations that were occurring elsewhere in society.

American Dream. In The American Family Home, 1800-1960, Clifford Edward Clarke, Jr discusses the notion of the 'American Dream,' including its history and precedents. Clarke generalizes that among the middle class, homes are a symbol of upward mobility. Specific housing types begin to dominate the landscape as features of everyday life are shared by most households. Clarke also describes that competition with one’s neighbors often accompanies the notion of home ownership. Similarly, in Where We Lived: Discovering the Places We Once Called Home: The American Home from 1775 to 1840, Jake Larkin uses photographs, drawings, and documents from the Historic American Buildings Survey to reflect on the development of American home construction. Larkin’s stated goal is to depict a house as a machine for living, while taking into account what those homes mean to the individuals or families that live there. In The Evolving House: A History of the Home, Albert Farwell Bemis and John Burchard show that homes evolve over time due changing societal expectations and inhabitant requirements.

Many authors have written scholarly books on the role of American home in society. These books place the home at the center of many societal reforms, including the women’s movement and the settlement house movement. Gwendolyn Wright’s Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in America chronicles the American domestic environment as it evolves from the earliest colonial architecture through urban renewal schemes and mass-development projects. Wright links thirteen different kinds of dwellings to architectural and ideological models that play an important role in the development of American society and common culture. David Handlin’s The American Home: Architecture and Society, 1815-1915 analyzes the diverse impacts of the home on the development of early American society and 
popular culture. Handlin, an architect and teacher, begins with the Colonial period; and presents the role of Andrew Jackson Downing on the form of American homes as well as references to home in the writings of Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau. These books enrich our understanding of the home as they speak to the importance and relevance in a larger context.

Thus it is crucial that the technical ingenuity and industrial heritage of the American lumber industry is preserved before all remains are relegated to a museum and replaced by new technology. While the production of modern engineered wood products has created a niche market within the industry, new modified and augmented lumber released each year slowly replace their predecessors that contain only wood. Historians, documentarians and preservationists must soon act to record this stalwart of American manufacturing before the lumber industry ceases to exist altogether."

## [Growth of the Lumber Industry](http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/171/growth-of-the-lumber-industry-1840-to-%091930) ##
"Mississippi’s abundant virgin forest had long been a natural resource for American Indians. And to the early 19th-century settlers from Europe and America’s east coast, the softwoods and hardwoods provided material for building homes, furniture, farm implements, and tools. Even so, settlers considered the millions of acres of forests as little more than obstacles to be removed in order to start developing farms.

The few people who lived in South Mississippi’s pineland before 1840, for example, made their living by hunting and trapping, and later by raising cattle and hogs. By the 1840s, a few small mills for sawing logs had been built along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The sawmills were located near the mouths of major rivers and streams at locations such as Pearlington and Logtown along the Pearl River, Moss Point on the Escatawpa and Pascagoula rivers, and Handsboro on the banks of Bayou Bernard near present-day Gulfport."

"These early mills depended on water transportation to ship logs to the mills. Loggers cut trees along the banks of streams. They then tied the logs together to form rafts that were then floated downstream to sawmills at the mouths of coastal rivers."


"But it was the building of railroads in Mississippi in the last quarter of the 19th-century that had the greatest impact on the timber industry. Railroads made it possible to build the large sawmills that dominated the industry by the early 1900s. The significance of railroads to loggers can be seen in the following statistics: In 1880, 295 sawmills had a total investment of less than one million dollars. Nearly twenty years later, in 1899, a capital investment of $10 million in 608 mills produced more than one billion board feet of lumber (a board foot is the equivalent of a board one foot by one foot by one inch).

The thriving timber industry during the 1904 to 1915 period ranked Mississippi in third place of lumber-producing states in the United States, behind Washington and Louisiana. In 1910, capital investment reached more than $39 million and the value of production climbed to nearly $43 million. Much of the total production was long-leaf yellow pine from the southern half of the state. In addition, many hardwood mills operated in the Delta region, and the east-central area of the state produced short-leaf pine."

"Sawmills depended on the railroads to ship finished lumber to growing markets in the north. Also, ports like Gulfport sprang up expanding the export lumber trade with foreign countries. Several railroads, such as the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, the Mobile, Jackson and Kansas City Railroad, and the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad, were built across South Mississippi.

Not only did railroads provide an outlet for finished products, they also opened up great areas of previously inaccessible timberland to lumber companies. As timber near the navigable streams was rapidly depleted, railroads provided mills a way to bring in logs that were far from rivers and streams.

Thus, many mills built their own rail lines into their timberlands. These rail lines, often called dummy lines, varied in length from mile-long railroads built with wooden rails to extensive railroads with steel rails that reached thirty or more miles into the virgin forests. By 1905, most sawmills cutting more than 25,000 board feet per day owned their own railroads.

Many towns and cities in Mississippi owe their existence to the railroads and sawmills built during the lumber boom. Typically, after a railroad was built, land buyers purchased timberland in the area and built sawmills. Towns quickly grew up around the sawmills. Many towns seemed to appear magically out of nowhere. Some of the towns became cities that still exist today — Hattiesburg, Laurel, Picayune, and Wiggins. Other towns — Inda, Howison, Hillsdale, Orvisburg, Deemer, and Electric Mills — quickly died after the mills closed.

Labor-saving equipment introduced soon after the turn of the century joined with railroads to spur growth. By 1905, the ancient caralog, a heavy ox-driven two-wheeled wagon, was replaced by the Lindsey Eight-Wheel Wagon invented by the Lindsey brothers of Laurel, Mississippi. In turn the skidder and steam log loader replaced the eight-wheel wagon. Skidders were huge winches with long cables. These cables were attached to logs, and the winches dragged them to the railhead. Such mechanizations cut logging costs and allowed for year-round operations."

## [Trucking and Automation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/20/rigged-system-rips-off-port-truckers-editorials-debates/103015290/) ##
"Many U.S. consumers care deeply about the way their products are made. Some insist on buying American; others press corporations for codes of conduct that forbid sweatshops in foreign lands.

"But what many might not know is that some highly deplorable conditions exist right here in America, in the transport of goods rather than their manufacture.

A huge volume of the nation's imports arrive by container ship in Southern California, where short-haul truckers take the merchandise to nearby rail yards or storage depots, a key step in the goods' journey to some of the nation's leading retail stores. A year-long investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that a good chunk of the port trucking industry relies heavily on a modern-day form of indentured servitude.

The abuse starts when a trucking company pressures its drivers to sign lease-to-own contracts on their tractor-trailer rigs. Often, these drivers speak little English and do not understand what they are getting into."


"Network reporter Brett Murphy documented hundreds of cases like this at Los Angeles ports since 2010, including 1,150 instances in which drivers had filed formal complaints, 140 trucking companies that had been accused by at least one driver of shorting drivers on pay, and more than 120 cases in which drivers said they worked 12 to 20 hours at a time, in violation of federal highway safety laws."


"Federal law has numerous workplace protections, but only for employees. The trucking companies at the Port of Los Angeles classify their drivers, incorrectly in many cases, as independent contractors rather than employees."


"If a category of worker is to exist outside of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other workplace protection laws, Congress needs to either delegate workplace authority to the states, or set minimum standards to protect contract workers against exploitation."


"The industry points to a study stating that drivers like being independent contractors. But the study is commissioned by the industry, uses data not available to outsiders, and includes long-haul drivers as well as the port truckers who are the subject of so much abuse."


## [Review: The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream](https://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2017/10/review-big-rig-trucking-and-decline-american-dream) ##
"Truck drivers seem to have re-entered the public consciousness in 2017—but today our understanding of the occupation is far from the freewheeling “cowboy of the highway” image of the 1970s. It’s also no longer synonymous with “Teamster” or even seen as a desirable job.

These days most talk about truckers centers on self-driving vehicles and the prospect that more than three million professional drivers will be replaced by robots. Business writers excitedly write about how this “cost-saving” technology lies just around the corner, only briefly pausing to consider the social crisis that would be created by laying off so many workers.

As a truck driver myself, I know that so much of what we do is far too complicated to be replaced by technology any time soon. We do a lot more than just hold a steering wheel. We navigate city streets and highways that are perpetually “under construction,” deal with distracted drivers who spend more time looking at their phones than at the road, maneuver impossibly narrow spaces to make deliveries, and back trailers up to dock doors, sometimes across traffic, with no room for error—and that's just what we do from the driver’s seat, not counting time for inspections, dropping and hooking, loading and unloading."


"As 27-year driver Greg Simmons says in a recent New York Times profile of long-haul truckers, “We’re throwaway people. Nobody cares about us.” Simmons says he feels trapped in an occupation that no longer provides a decent living, thanks to corporate innovations like the pay-by-mile system, which doesn’t account for all the hours drivers get stuck in traffic or wait on trailers to be loaded or unloaded, a process that often takes hours.

For truckers at the ports who move goods from ships to warehouses, the situation is even worse. An in-depth USA Today report (June 20, 2017) exposed the terrible conditions faced by immigrants driving trucks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, describing their situation as “modern-day indentured servitude.”

Many port truckers are locked into lease agreements in which a large portion of their wages goes toward their truck and vehicle maintenance. Their bosses use these leasing agreements to force drivers into punishing schedules, threatening them with losing their truck (and forfeiting all the wages paid into the truck) if they refuse to work beyond the legal maximum hours or if they get sick and can't work. They are also often misclassified as “independent contractors,” depriving drivers of basic protections like overtime compensation, family and medical leave, and unemployment insurance."


"Deregulation, beginning with President Carter and continued by Ronald Reagan, did away with the federal permit system and encouraged thousands of new carriers to enter the industry. By dramatically increasing competition, both shipping prices and wages were driven down considerably. It became more affordable for shippers to use 'truckload' shipments, where a trailer is filled exclusively with one shipper’s freight and sent directly to its destination, instead of relying on the union-dense “less than truckload” terminals to move smaller shipments."

"Most days, the trucker would drive more than 16 hours straight hauling LG dishwashers and Kumho tires to warehouses around Los Angeles, on their way to retail stores nationwide."


"He rarely went home to his family. At night, he crawled into the back of his cab and slept in the company parking lot."


"Talavera was a modern-day indentured servant. And there are hundreds, likely thousands more, still on the road, hauling containers for trucking companies that move goods for America’s most beloved retailers, from Costco to Target to Home Depot.

These port truckers -- many of them poor immigrants who speak little English -- are responsible for moving almost half of the nation’s container imports out of Los Angeles’ ports. They don't deliver goods to stores. Instead they drive them short distances to warehouses and rail yards, one small step on their journey to a store near you.

A yearlong investigation by the USA TODAY Network found that port trucking companies in southern California have spent the past decade forcing drivers to finance their own trucks by taking on debt they could not afford. Companies then used that debt as leverage to extract forced labor and trap drivers in jobs that left them destitute.

Using the contracts, submitted as evidence in labor complaints, and shipping manifests, reporters matched the trucking companies with the most labor violations to dozens of retail brands, including Target, Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot, Hasbro, J.Crew, UPS, Goodyear, Costco, Ralph Lauren and more.

This isn’t a case of a few bad trucking companies accused of mistreating a handful of workers.

Since 2010, at least 1,150 port truck drivers have filed claims in civil court or with the California Department of Industrial Relations’ enforcement arm, known as the labor commission."


"Prominent civil rights leader Julian Bond once called California port truckers the new black tenant farmers of the post-Civil War South. Sharecroppers from that era rented farmland to make their living and regularly fell into debt to their landlords. Widespread predatory practices made it nearly impossible for the farmers to climb out.

Through lease contracts, California’s port truckers face the same kinds of challenges in ways that experts say rarely happen in the U.S. today.

You’re working to get yourself out of the debt. You just don’t see anything like that.

Reporters tried to contact owners and managers at more than 30 trucking companies. Many did not respond or declined to comment."


"Retailers don't directly hire the truckers who move their goods at the pier. They generally hire large shipping or logistics firms that line up trucking companies through a maze of subcontractors."


"Truckers at dozens of companies describe the same basic scene. They were handed a lease-to-own contract by their employer and given a choice: Sign immediately or be fired. Many drivers who spoke little English said managers gave them no time to seek legal advice or even an interpreter to read the contract

Drivers gave their old trucks – many of which they owned outright – to their company as a down payment. And just like that they were up to $100,000 in debt to their own employer. The same guys would have had a tough time qualifying for a Hyundai days earlier."


"For years, Rene Flores regularly has driven 20 hours a day, six days a week, hauling pistachios and medical equipment into the desert from the Port of Long Beach.

'If I don’t work,” Flores says, “my kids will starve.'

He keeps a log book of fake hours in the glovebox and the real one hidden beneath his seat in case of a surprise inspection."

## [The Uncultured South](https://www.vqronline.org/essay/uncultured-south) ##
"Has the South been buffaloing America for half a century into thinking it was a second Athens wrecked by a Northern barbarian democracy, when actually the second Athens drank mint juleps, ate batter-bread, and thought up moral defenses for the institution that made life comfortable? Is the culture of the Old South a myth?

Or was the Pennsylvanian right who said: 'Why do I live in Virginia? Because Virginia once had a civilization. It hasn’t one any longer, of course. But it did have one once. And Pennsylvania never had a civilization.' Apparently, even Pennsylvanians have admitted the Old Southern culture.

There is no use asking the South. The South has been on the defensive for so many decades that it has lost the art of self-examination. And since the World War, the South has been sold on progress, with the result that under the guidance of its Young Men’s Business Clubs it has deserted its glorious bloody past for a rosy and profitable future. Its traditions are turning into points of interest. It is capitalizing the Lost Cause.

And yet, one would like to know who is right about this business of an Old Southern culture. What does intelligent America, outside the South, think? In pondering the matter, I am inclined to believe that the American attitude towards the Old South has passed through three distinct phases: the third phase, the batter-bread expos is a thing of recent years. The three phases are worth comparing.

Before 1860 the Southern planters were the greedy plutocracy of slaveholders in a day when all other civilized countries had abolished slavery, grabbing for new territories into which they might extend their 'peculiar institution,' thus holding their balance of power in a “free” republic. To that republic they were by their very nature a menace, just as the republic was a menace to conservative Europe. 'Not by, aggression,' wrote Oliver Wendell Holmes, 'but by the naked fact of existence we are an eternal danger and an unsleeping threat to every government that founds itself on anything but the will of the governed.' Similarly in a land that promised the destruction of all privilege, the Southern slaveholder was a mockery to hopeful utopists and a pledge of possible reaction. Before the Civil War, therefore, the North dreaded and vilified the Southern system.

After the Civil War the North offered cordiality in exchange for penitence. It even offered a queer kind of sentimentalized love. Now that the North had “licked” the South, it could afford to love it. Lo the poor planter, having been broken at Appomattox, had much to be said for his way of life. The South has been widely accused of slobbering about its destroyed system but actually the South has been more slobbered over than slobbering. I have never met a profounder or marshier sentimentality than the applause of certain Northern crowds when the band played 'Dixie.' All of which has been psychologically very bad for the South. She was undoubtedly sick, but an overdose of sympathy never helped sickness yet.

Lee and Jackson were traitors while McClellan’s act was on. But with Appomattox a dim memory, Lee’s stock went up in the North and the North bought in by the block. They ended up by feeling a sort of pride in a national pageant that had a happy ending.

For example: in a London theater I sat watching Drink-water’s 'Robert E. Lee.' Between acts I listened to the audience struggling with teacups and chocolates and fought to keep from crying. The lady next me was from Indiana but took me for an emotional Britisher.

'I don’t suppose,' she began informatively, 'you know much about this. We study it in School. It’s History, for us. My grandfather fought in this war—of course on the winning side.' Of course. My contention is that as the winning side the North took a generous interest in the South and that, provided the South accepted the Northern social economy, the North luxuriated in approval for the fallen tyrants whose spacious lives they almost envied.

Moreover the strings were there. The South was expected to be glad the right side won. Only last October, at Fredericksburg, Virginia, President Coolidge, in his campaign speech over the Confederate dead, congratulated the South on getting beaten and on being glad they were beaten. Assuming they really were glad, he praised Lee. I used to experiment by declaring to Northerners that I regretted the South had failed to win her independence. My remark always dried the springs of sympathy in a hurry: in short, my. experiment succeeded.

However, after the war fewer and fewer Southerners made this experiment, and the North was free to indulge a safe sympathy. The North even took to romancing about it, as industrial England romanced about feudalism. For a thousand reasons the feudal barons of Norman England and the cotton barons of the British Empire could never have tolerated each other in the flesh. But in the grave the feudal barons shed a safe and glamorous luster. Hence romanticism.

Similarly the slave system did not seem wholly bad in retrospect. Freed by Emancipation from the nightmare of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the North took note of the Southern mammy, the pickaninnies, the leisurely life of the plantation, and wove a sweet dream about it. The plantation owner became in this dream a kindly, cultivated master, dividing his time between his acres, his library, and good conversation. Material for his portrait was drawn from three sources: the necessity to flatter, by a law of psychological compensation, what one had been compelled by morality to destroy; the inherited respect for upper-class privilege that a century’s war on privilege had not obliterated; and a vivid imagination, which read into the planter of the Old South those qualities the raw democracy was most ashamed of lacking and most wanted to acquire. The result was a very romantic portrait indeed.

But now came the realistic analysts, known in the New Age of Reason as the 'de-bunkers.' They pounced on that faded splendor of honeysuckle and magnolia and they announced, and are announcing in a palpitation of discovery, that the honeysuckle and magnolia were there but the books were not, nor were the Shakespeares and Raphaels and Mozarts. And, of course, magnolias are not culture. Just because the Old South was tragic in its ruin, there is no use romancing about it. There is more culture, more creative art, in New York today, and indeed in living Southern novelists, than the Old South ever dreamed of.

Why have these analysts only just appeared, and is there anything in what they say? There is rather obviously, in the New York sense. New York is measuring culture by creative art and comically but inevitably enough by the amount of creative art. New York wants better novelists but it also wants more of them. New York studies art output, and with growing pride. The publishers, critics, and art dealers are particularly impressed, and they cue the public. America hopes for an imminent Renaissance.

An imminent Renaissance would have mystified the planters. In the first place theirs remained a distinctly colonial culture long after the American Revolution. They were in many respects an English squirarchy more inconveniently distant from the London Season than squires in Yorkshire or Devon. But they sat down to tables of Santo Domingo mahogany turned in London, before English plate, to drink the same wines Englishmen were drinking. They frequently sent their sons to English universities. They were economically, and to a far greater extent socially, colonials.

For that reason their libraries were often astonishingly complete but ran to classics, not novelties. Anybody who has ever seen the ghost of one of those plantations knows that, living there, one would want Dryden and Pope, Fielding and the learned Doctor Samuel. And every time one of those libraries goes under the hammer I am struck afresh by the solidity of the planter’s literary digestion. They read what their class in England read.

Their portraits are frequently from European hands. I imagine this struck them as natural. Europe was in every respect a more suitable environment for an artist than young America. And I do not believe the planter’s patriotic heart ached because there was so little home talent. The cultivated class of Southern planters were part of the same cultural complex as Europe, and their geographical position and isolated manner of living condemned them to be consumers rather than producers. Most cultivated persons at any time in any place are consumers; or ought to be. It is a fairly recent thing to have everybody about to write a novel. And the line between self-expression and exhibitionism wobbles only too readily.

Culturally indeed the planters were in one line producers. They were rulers by instinct and training, and artists in war and politics. A glance at the roll call of planter statesmen from Jefferson on, and of the men who led the South’s last army, suffices to illustrate this. The South maintained what is so conspicuously absent from America today, a ruling class, bred for the purpose.

Like every genuine ruling class the planters held to a code of manners. And manners can be a very definite art. To live gracefully, harmoniously, and freely may be as creative as Russian ballet and more truly creative than a book about one’s not always interesting friends, written in a seldom interesting manner.

Or take hospitality. There has been a vast amount of twaddle talked about Southern hospitality. The fact remains that, where still practiced, it is an art as complex and as easily recognized as the weaving of real Persian rugs. By people, of course, who know good rugs. Twelve years ago a traveller told me Southern hospitality was a myth. He had visited every big town in the South and they were the most intolerably inhospitable places he knew. No theaters, no amusements, and a courtesy that nevertheless forbade intimacy. This confusion of hotelling and hospitality tells the whole story. My friend would fare better in the New South, where the Chambers of Commerce would care for him. They would make him pay for it, but he would expect that. His only trouble was wanting to buy what was not for sale. And if I had explained that he had no letters of introduction he would have snorted at Southern snobbery.

Probably the planter’s least American trait was his exquisite sense of leisure. He enjoyed life enormously and his zest was not based on externals, on money, on success. He worked to make life possible but he never made a god of occupation. And this leisure permitted him to flower as a human personality. Since flowering is the last thing a democracy will ever understand, America asks the planter if his leisure was fruitful. That depends on what we consider fruit. Shall one measure life by output or beauty? Which would an artist do?

His leisure brought the planter one of his most successful minor arts and one he most delighted in—good conversation. For in his virtues and in his vices alike he was a social animal. The best Southern conversation, even what is left of it today, has led me to believe that it may be the most delightful oral literature now alive in any civilized or semi-civilized country. And when the Southerner told a perfect anecdote and told it as perfectly as that anecdote could be told, he did not call for the printer and start figuring royalties. He told another. The truth is, an original mind that is not haunted by the awful fear of being uninformed, that is illumined by a playful humor not based on vaudeville wise-cracks or jaded slang, is as rare in America as a knowledge of good wines. Hence our very general and panicky boredom; hence the fact that we so often bore others. I am not fool enough to suppose that this good conversation and this quiet leisure would pass as cultural currency in the America that came of age. At best, they would have the value of Confederate money: they are antiques. They can be collected, but they are not the basis of America’s economy or of her culture. There is no Federal Reserve behind either one. And it is, of course, pure romanticism to think that leisure can stand up against Rusiness, or Confederate notes against greenbacks: this sort of competition is settled by “economic necessity,” which commonly plays havoc with culture. We Americans admit that leisure is good; we even subsidize research workers to study how to use it; but we will not let it interfere with Life. To the planter, leisure did not have to be studied: it was itself the basis of a life worth living.

I have been guilty here of writing what many know as well as I, and of venturing many unproved generalizations, as indeed one must if one compares two social orders at all, in an effort to see whether a case could not be made out for an Old Southern culture, whether the planter’s way of life did not imply a culture even in the absence of a stream of printed matter, canvases, and sonatas. I can both cut short and clarify my discussion by stating that the essence of the Old South was a spirit of aristocracy.

Aristocracy exists only where there is faith in the worth-whileness of some intangible values. And only where there is that faith can life have a more significant form than the form achieved in a pigsty. The Old Southerner believed in a whole list of musty-sounding intangibles that curl the lip of the democracy: courage in men, chastity in women, hatred of lying, scorn of greed, loyalty to one’s superiors, fidelity to one’s retainers, reticence in intimacy, grace in all things. He could not prove they were worthwhile; nor can the democracy prove they are not. But that is how he felt about life—which is the Law for aristocracy.

To the average American today the Southern planter is as weirdly comic as Don Quixote. But nothing whatever is proved by that except that he is growing very rare. Sometimes he is laughed at. Mostly he is just overlooked. But now and then when democracy does see him or hears one of his funny abstract words again, it challenges his claim to culture. Well, he took his another wav. He took a frank pleasure in the good things of life, including a number of world literatures. But he could never have grasped the bourgeois-proletarian concept of self-improvement. The fact of aristocracy was to him one of the most obvious facts of life. Some of his land was better than the rest and therefore better for certain crops. He had draught horses for hauling, and thoroughbreds to race. He believed his negroes were better fitted to work than to rule. Some white men were “better bred” than others and therefore better fitted to lead and direct. These were facts. Land could of course be improved; so could horses; so could people, over stretches of time. Sometimes lower breeds threw out an extraordinary individual, but mostly breeds ran true to form—a fortunate fact for a planter. The American credo that holds college courses as universally desirable and looks to correspondence schools as a means of converting ill-bred people into the other sort would have struck him as a lamentable farce. A percheron need never be ridiculous except on the track.

It is this profound cleavage between the democratic and the aristocratic sets of values that is responsible for the three successive attitudes America has adopted toward the 'South.' Before the Civil War the Southern oligarchy with all the strength of axiomatic tradition behind it threatened to wreck the American experiment. Appomattox broke that oligarchy on the wheel. It did not mean that never again should the South be powerful, but it did mean that its power must never take aristocratic form. America, at least the Eastern states, no longer afraid, wove romances around a social system still dormant in its own blood. But during the last decade the American democracy, bourgeois-proletarian in spirit, has so completely obliterated every other social form that the Old South is losing even its romance. Half amazed and half relieved, America realizes that she does not really want the things the Old South wanted, except power, which she has in increasing abundance. America wants to read more books, see more things, build more houses, acquire more culture. And the South never tried to acquire it. America doesn’t believe the South ever had a culture.

The other day as I was leaving Woolworth’s in a small Southern town, an old gentleman of the planter breed, more than a generation my senior, started to enter. Unfortunately at that very moment a number of flappers started out. The old man stood back, holding the door open. I counted over twenty people, men and women, who rushed past him without a word. I shall always treasure the memory of his smile. The pigs were in the parlor, and he had the courage to smile! It would be more worthwhile for us Americans, Northerners and Southerners, to study that smile than to read the riddle of the Sphinx. Regardless of culture."

## [Southern White Patriarchy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335328771_Southern_White_Patriarchy) ##
"The pedestal upon which southern white womanhood stands is buttressed by an equally sacred southern white masculinity characterized by a distorted notion of honor, a penchant for violence, and male righteousness and superiority. Thus, Second-Wave Feminism spurred not only a defiant anti-feminism with which many white southern men and women identified, but also a men’s rights campaign that portrayed men as victims of reverse discrimination and promoted a dominant and defensive masculinity that was very familiar to southern white audiences. This misogyny, along with a religious assertion of manhood that was popular in southern evangelical churches, provided Republicans with an opportunity to build their partisan brand among white southerners. Often masked by romanticized notions of chivalry, southern white masculinity depends upon a patriarchal system and the traditional gender roles inherent in that system. The GOP would appeal to both as it chased southern white voters throughout the Long Southern Strategy."

## [Crying Shame: The Power of White Woman's Tears](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/crying-shame-the-power-of-white-women-s-tears-20190820-p52iy7.html) ## 
"One of the earliest critiques of White Womanhood comes from one of the most underrated figures of the suffragette era. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was a poet, journalist, fiction writer and a formidable presence on the abolitionist speakers’ circuit.

In 1866 she gave a far-sighted speech at the 11th National Women’s Rights Convention in New York City before a crowd that included key suffragist figures Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.

'We are all bound up in one great bundle of humanity, and society can’t trample on the weakest and feeblest among its members without receiving the curse in its own soul,' she declared.

You white women speak of rights, I speak of wrongs. I do not believe that giving white women the ballot is immediately going to cure all the ills of society. I do not believe that white women are dew-drops just exhaled from the skies.

Harper argued the condition of poor white men in the South was a direct consequence of the law favouring rich slave-owners: in enslaving black men, white men paralysed the moral strength of the nation and the rights of lower-class whites. Likewise, in the cities of the North, white women were turning away when black women tried to hail streetcars only to find the conductor refused to let them ride.

'Have women nothing to do with this? While there exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and selfishness, it is the white women of America.'

The key, then, to white women’s liberation lay in whether or not they considered black women to be women like themselves, and in using this recognition as the first step in building a fairer society. Sadly, those white women didn’t and arguably many still don’t. Rather than rejecting the concept of white women as virtuous "dew-drops" inherently equipped to right the wrongs of their white male counterparts, white women have largely chosen to navigate and bolster the existing system to gain some advantages, which necessarily come at the expense of people of colour. And this has meant adopting the persona of the damsel in distress.

Perhaps no story encapsulates this more clearly and tragically than that of Emmett Till. The 14-year-old from Chicago was visiting family in 1955 Mississippi when he was accused of whistling at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant. Abducted by a group of white men including Bryant’s husband, he was beaten to death and dumped in the Tallahassee River. His killers were acquitted by an all-white jury. In 2018, Bryant recanted her testimony, admitting Till had not harassed her in any way.

This is the power of the white damsel in distress. It is a power that is not in the past.

We see this modern-day dynamic of white women’s innocence and virtue used as a justification for the oppression of brown and black bodies in the rhetoric of our politicians. Last year, US President Donald Trump invoked the protection of women as a rationale for demonising the so-called 'migrant caravan' - the dehumanising name given to the thousands of people attempting to make their way from Central America to the US border in the hope of finding safety. He conjured up the image of the white damsel, saying, ‘Women want security. Women don’t want that caravan’, echoing the messages of slavery, segregation and more recent white supremacist literature.

In 1997, sociologist Abby L. Ferber published White Man Falling, a discourse analysis of newsletters and magazines printed by white supremacist groups. What she found, along with a preoccupation with 'saving' Western civilisation and restoring the reputation of the white Western male, was an obsession with policing the bodies of white women and the borders of 'white' countries.

'America is being invaded by a deluge of legal and illegal non-White intruders: swarms of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Negro, Oriental and Jewish scum who are thronging across our wide-open borders,' thundered one publication, arguing that this 'unarmed invasion' threatened the white race because of the possibility of white women 'crossbreeding with inferior specimens', which would lead to the end of the white race through the contamination of white blood with 'inferior blood'.

The logic of policing racial boundaries is not new. It is the foundation that all settler-colonies were built on.

'I am being harassed': Damsels in distress

The white damsel has enjoyed an online resurgence in this era of viral memes, and the past couple of years have seen a proliferation of white women caught on camera in the United States calling the police on black people for simply existing.

Perhaps no meme better exposes the dangerous fiction that lies at the heart of the white damsel in distress trope than 'BBQ Becky'. In this viral video, a middle-aged white woman can be seen on her mobile phone angrily requesting police show up to eject a black family barbecuing in a park. After many words of consternation between Becky and the white woman who is filming her, a defiant Becky refuses to return a business card belonging to the other woman and storms off.

The camera follows her, and the transformation in Becky’s demeanour is remarkable to witness. In a matter of minutes, she goes from assertive to combative to aggressive to defiant, and finally, when she spots and rushes towards a bewildered-looking white male police officer, becomes the white damsel in distress. Bursting into tears when she reaches her apparent rescuer, she manages to heave out a few words between gulping sobs: 'I am being harassed.'

This incident demonstrates that white women are not only aware of their privileged status in society but use it to surreptitiously manipulate and dominate people of colour, only to resort to the damsel in distress archetype of white female innocence and victimhood when challenged.

The original damsel in distress trope was a way for white women to exercise some limited power. I say 'limited' not because it didn’t have far-reaching effects but because it required white women to adhere to strict rules to be accepted. The damsel is an infantilised woman whose purity and innocence is both inherent and sanctified, leading to her perceived reliance on men and to the obsession with virginity that persists even in a Western world that is supposedly sexually liberated.

The damsel ensured white women were at least considered human, even though it relegated them to subordinate status. But it did so by ruthlessly excluding non-white women from the construction of womanhood. It is not that non-white women were considered inferior to white women: they were not considered to be women at all. The damsel can only be white.

Only white women were considered worthy of protecting, because only white women could ensure the continuation of a 'pure white race'. Black women, Indigenous women, brown women: all colonised women were regarded as lacking in innocence because their bodies were already freely, openly and liberally transgressed by white men.

When white women invoke the damsel, they resurrect this bloody history. This is what makes white women’s tears so damaging and, yes, so violent when they are turned against people of colour. White women’s tears have little effect on white men - just ask Christine Blasey Ford, whose emotional testimony was not enough to prevent her alleged abuser being confirmed to the US Supreme Court - because they were never designed to implicate white men. This is why sexual violence by white men was rarely punished historically and why to this day so many white people still react so blithely to sexual assault and domestic violence perpetrated by white men, even when the victims are white women. This is why a self-confessed 'pussy grabber' can be elected president of the United States.

To be a white man in the white supremacist construction is to have the right to sexual access to all women, while at the same time sequestering the bodies of white women to prevent men of colour ingratiating themselves into white society.

A white man raping a white woman is not a threat to white male power. If it threatens to destroy the woman’s life then so be it. This, I believe, is why despite all our claims our society still does not take violence against women seriously. When perpetrated by white men, frequently such violence is ignored or blame heaped onto the victim. It is only when white women are violated or even imagined to be violated by non-white men that white society suddenly seems to find its moral compass.

This is not to say that men of colour never assault white women - they do - but the scale of the white fear of brown and black men raping innocent white women with no repercussions is a gross perversion of the historical reality. White fear betrays deep-seated anxieties about white men being "replaced" at the top of the racial and gender hierarchy and white society collapsing; I don’t mean the total destruction of society here - merely it no longer being solely in the control of white men and women.

White people as a collective still fear sharing power and status. They fear no longer being the special race. The Enlightened race. The civilised and civilising race. This is obvious to anyone watching the rise of right-wing 'populism', the alt-right and the resurgence of neo-Nazis. Perhaps, as people of colour half-joke, white people fear being treated the way they have long treated the minorities they have subordinated. At the very least, there appears to be a complete denial that the only thing that has made white people 'superior' is their own insistence that they are."

The pioneer women wore prairier dresses and bonnets, focused on education, and worked long hard hours to feed, clothe, and even protect their families from danger. These women were known as 'Prairie Madonnas' who 'made great pies, babies, and flour sack curtains...She kept immaculate house under impossible conditions - floors of raw dirt or unfinished woo' and she 'could handle a gun or help with the stock if her husband were away when the Indians attacked or if the cows broke down the fence."

"This book is about moving marginalized individuals in rodeo to the center; however, we cannot possibly tell the whole story. The ignorance of history, a belief in a White Western narrative that erased the contributions of Lation/as, American Indians, and African Americans, and the effects of racism and White privilege are why all those in rodeo are believed to be either White and/or White males. We are unable to resurrect those cowgirls likely that Wister saw and had knowledge of Latino, American Indian, and African American cowboys. Wister also knew that women were in the West, and yet their participation is erased, as well. In Wister's revisionist telling of the 'wild West' he recounts and admires only the hard, industrious work of White men. Through the creation of *The Virginian*, in 1902, Wister 'created the archetypal cowboy hero stamped with particular qualities that virtually all his successors would perpetuate. The creation of the archetypal cowboy and the use of the White man to be the hero to fight the villains of the West (normally seen as the 'Wild' Indian or Mexican 'Desperado'), and saving White women from the dangers of the West established rigid gender stereotypes. The establishment of these gender roles helped influence the positions that owmen and ethnic minorities have in modern rodeo, because they reifed the social norms and themes that were constructed in the United States for what was appropriate for each group of people. Wister's focus on admiration for the White race sat well with his contemporaries like Rudyard Kipling, as well as with other U.S. policy and laws of the time. For example, in 1896 the U.S. Supreme Court passed the Federal Plessy v. Ferguson law, which ushered in Jim Crow, or a 'separate but equal' policy, which segregated Black and White Americans. This Federal law remained in place through 1964. In addition, in 1900 White males in the U.S. elected William McKinley, who further popularized Kipling's 1899 poem 'The White Man's Burden,' a treatise on 'the white man's burden' belief, which focused on cultural and racial imperialism. In 1900, this policy impacted U.S. and Philippines relations and U.S. and China relations (the Boxer Rebellion in China), and in 1901 it affected U.S. and Cuban relations (the Platt Amendment). Not suprisingly, given this time perio and the aforementioned U.S. laws, the myth of the West and the myth of rodeo are tied to White westward expansion. There is a parallel etween the dangers the pioneers faced during their quest of Manifest Destiny - the hostile elements, raging rivers, outlaws, Indians - and the cowboys' dnagers faced in rodeo. Later, these same racist ideals were put on film when Thomas Dixon's book, *The Clansman* (1905), was turned into the move, *Birth of A Nation*, which was directed by D. W. Griffith in 1915. Dixon was a classmate of former President Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson had a special screening of the movie at the White House, where the Supreme Court was also in attendance. As media scholar Donald Bogle noted, the film 'would work audiences into a frenzy...[I]t will make you hate.' This movie heralded the KKK as the saviors of the White race and protectors of White womanhood and virginity from the Black male brute who was no longer controlled by the system of slavery, and increased White male membership in the terrorist organization."

"legal scholar Margaret Russell"
"through a carefully constructed fusion of unprecedented technical wizadry and degrading racial stereotypes, Griffith sought to convince his audience that his was the 'true' story of the old South and that white domination was necessary for their survival. To a great extent, he succeeded: The film's enormous popularity fueled the growing influence of the Klan, and *The Birth of a Nation* remains to this day one of the highest-grossing box office successes in Hollywood history." 

"Wister's novel went through 'fifteen printings during the first eigh months after its publication; by 1911 it was in its thirty-eight printing. By 1938, it had sold mroe than one and one-half million copies.'"
"While not everyone embraced Wister's East Coast take on the West, and while other novels later existed, *The Virginian* was considered a seminal work that cemented the myth of the White American West in the U.S. imagination, as well as of the iconic stoic, independent cowboy, who is always visually depicted as a White man."

"The American cowboy is idealized in folklore as masculine, independent, and an explore. Curiosity as a foundational element of human existence led to the stereotype of the cowboy myth, which continues to be embraced. Early explorers liek Coronado in 1541, and later Lewis and Clark in the early 1800s, said the American West was a vast open plain, a desert where one could conquer man, land, and beast. The untamed elements of the Western frontier remain static in the narrative of the West. Ideally, the American cowboy and the narrative of the Western frontier were painted with heroic myths worthy of 'god-like' worship, whereby the embellishment of the narrative outshone the lived reality of the frontier."

"The exclusionary dominance of the White cowboy as a representative of the West in rodeo depictions and as portrayed in dime novels, film, and folklore is that he is believed to be anyone: that person any White Anglo Saxon Protestant (WASP) male could become."

"He is not complicated in his white/black binary vision of the world; you are either good or bad and the judgment coms from his 'correct' attitudes, beliefs, and values, which are ideals found within the cowboy culture and code - the Code of the West. He symbolizes the possibility of what can be achieved thorugh a hard work ethic and through traditional gender roles that reinforce Victorian ideals of White womanhood, e.g., a helpless virginal damsel in distress who needs the protection and direction of a strong man to react against any transgression committed against her. Our hero in this Western White myth is complete with his leathered face and Western drawl. He is armed with is trusty six-shooter, while keeping an eye out for American Indians. '[The] Anglo-Saxon cowboy and the Red Indian emerged as convenient action heroes. These simplified stick figures propagated a frontier mythology that hid both the systemic violence of conquest and the modern incorporation of land and labor. Cowboy hats and warrior headdresses obscured the complex racial politics of the United States and created instead a ronatic duel of white against red.' From this duel of reductionist cowboy ideals, race, and land emerged an American iconic myth (the cowboy) that is actually a conglomeration of 'White conquering West' rhetoric, media fascination, and myths - like the explorations of Daniel Boone - which loomed larger than life. The myths of man besting beast carried over into the rodeo cowboy arena."

"The cowboy represents the taming of the forces of North American civliziation. In the arena, these great forces clash. The cowboy hero attempts to 'tame the wild...'"

"Wister's novel went through 'fifteen printings during the first eight months after its publication; by 1911 it was in its thirty-eight printing. By 1938, it had sold more than one and one-half million copies.'"

"the histories of the American West...[of] heroci tales: stories of adventure, exploration, and conflict."

"overcome a conflict, seek adventure, and explore new territory"

"The rodeo cowboy is only one of the numbers of modern occupational folk hero types, yet he is a fascinating one. He is, after all, a modern man - he lives in industrial America...sleeps at the Holiday Inn....[Y]et on the other hand he is a cowboy - representing facets of North America's past that evoke powerful rural and pre-industrial images. This makes for a fascinating paradox."

"The rodeo cowboy embodies two different men. On one hand, he is modern and experiences all of the modern conveniences that are available, yet he is also a man whose job it is to recreate the Wild West for entertainment. He retells an age old story of good versus evil while attempting to tame the wild, even while making a career out of being a show performer. The rodeo road for our cowboy hero has been built from a diverse history, starting with the Wild West shows."

"Amazon" - "cowgirls"

"Free fromt he confines of the corset, cowgirls were seen as powerful, as talented, and with fewer restrictions placed upon them. The transition from a Victorian Ideal in the East to a free-spirited lifestyle in the West was embraced wholeheartedly by the cowgirls in the arean;a the media and the society, however, were less willing to give up on the feminine side of cowgirls. Media stories highlighted the cowgirls' achievements, but also made sure to mention their domesticity in order to appease women in the East and all men's notions of 'true' womanhood."

"the flapper", "this new woman of the 1920s"

"a true woman was a true woman"
"the Cult of True Womanhood promoted in 'women's magazines, gift annuals, and religious literature made women hostages in their home'"
"These cultural feminists promoted the belief that '[all] women occupied the private sphere and men occupied the public domain.'"
"This belief prevailed in Western society for many years, because as 'values changed frequently...fortunes rose and fell with frightening rapidity...social and economic mobility provided instability as well as hope, one thing at least remained the same - a true woman was a true woman."
"In 1976 Barbara Welter coined the term 'The Cult of True Womanhood' to encapsulate Victorian gender ideology for women. The four cardinal virtues of the cult were piety, domesticity, and submissiveness that all 'true' women were expected to manifest in the nineteenth century."

"Annie Oakley was a 'true woman' who is credited with being the first performer to promote the 'All-American' cowgirl, which allowed her the freedom to compete athletically against men in her profession. Oakley was above criticism for her chosen profession by the 1890s. If one were to criticize her, it would be comparable to attacking a national icon, as she was able to take advantage of visual markers of White skin, long blonde hair, clothing, and a gender-conservative stance that made her a darling of White male notions of femininty. Oakley possessed monolithic cultural identity markers that contributed to White normative standards of beauty. These types of identity markers seem to belie the complexity of lived experiences for individuals. Having this nomrative standard of beauty coupled with her persona also protected her from being branded a 'floozy,' a derogatory term directed toward women in typical men's sports during this time period. She also differed from the 'New Woman' who was rallying for suffrage, education, and advancement. Although Annie Oakley was able to perform amazing feats inside the arena, she still preferred to act like a Victorian lady outside the arena." 

"'The [White and ethnic minority] cowgirl did not exist. The young women [regardless of race] did not go cavorting over the prairies astride bucking bronhco [sic]....[I]t would have seemed exceedingly immodest for a young woman to get astride a horse wearing any sort of riding habit. Any woman doing so would have been classed as a bawdy house character, and every home on the plains would have been closed to her."

"This is an interesting characterization, because being 'bawdy' typicallyr eferred to a woman's sexual nature. So a cowgirl was at risk fo being labeled as having a bawdy or sexual character for riding a horse incorrectly - not sidesaddle. Ironically, the safest way for a woman to ride a horse, astride the horse, was deemed bawdy. So, even if a cowgirl tossed the corset, she was still subject to patriarchal notions regarding her sexuality, depending upon how she sat on and rode the horse. If the White cowgirl was thought not to exist because her place was in the home, and had all of these patriarchal rules attached to her, then the erasure of the ethnic minority cowgirl was expected. Ethnic minority cowgirls had to be disenfranchised in order to make place for the 'non-existent' White cowgirl."

## [The South between Two Frontiers: Confederate Cowboys and Savage Rednecks]((https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237018811_The_South_between_Two_Frontiers_Confederate_Cowboys_and_Savage_Rednecks)) ## 
"The myth of the Frontier, which locates the birth of the American nation in its confrontation with a bordering savagery, was a national myth in western films until the 1960s. As a genre shaping the features of Americanness, the Western attracted many ex-confederates in search of political legitimacy and the western Frontier became a place of national rehabilitation for the South. When the narrative of the myth inverted in favor of the Indian in the late 1960s, freedmen replaced confederate heroes in their quest to integrate the national community on screen. The Frontier as America’s birthplace gave the South a second chance and revealed its cultural meaning for the nation. But the Frontier, in its confrontational version of the savage wars, also resonates with the myth of the Lost Cause, in which barbarous freedmen threaten white society. If Birth of a Nation was the first and last film in which Blacks were pictured as dangerous in Hollywood, this internal Frontier reappears with the cultural crisis of the 1960s, when the South becomes home to savages of a new kind, degenerate rednecks, who embody the failure of the national myth in the Western, and come to represent the endemic savagery of America revealed by My Lai and Charles Manson. The South in films wavers between two Frontiers: the Frontier of American regeneration in the Western, and the Frontier as a danger to America in the Southern."

## [Exploring Land, Settling Frontiers](http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/) ## 
"In the days before the Industrial Revolution created a middle class and wealth could be acquired through manufacturing, land for producing crops, wool, meat, and wood products was the basis of English wealth. Land was controlled by the hereditary aristocracy. Peasants had little opportunity to climb the social ladder and join the aristocracy, and little chance to become landowners with control over their own farms.

Roughly half of the population in England owned no land. No matter how hard they worked, those who did not inherit land had little expectation of acquiring it.

The English social system fractured as population grew from 3 million in 1500 to 5 million in 1650. Wealth remained sequestered in just a few families, high unemployment became common, and social unrest erupted into the English Civil War in the mid-1650's.1

An alternative to a lifetime of frustrating, never-ending poverty in England was emigration. Travel across the Atlantic Ocean was unpleasant and dangerous, and moving to the Virginia colony was a great risk. However, migration was the easiest way for many Englishmen to become landowners, and Virginia offered an opportunity for the minor gentry and even lower classes to climb into the upper ranks of wealth and power.

Speculation in land across the Atlantic Ocean spurred changes in traditional business practices in England. The Virginia Company was an early expression of a relatively new economic approach, the joint stock company. It was a legal tool where investors could pool their capital and risk, then share the rewards as a "corporation" rather than as individuals. If the speculative colonization venture failed, the investors' funds disappeared - but only those funds were put at risk, not the entire personal wealth of the investor."


"Explorers like Daniel Boone led the way for many farmers to clear the forest (or clear out the Native Americans) and get started with crops such as corn. Like Boone, not all settlers were savvy enough to retain their property, but many managed to provide a substantial inheritance to their children that would have been impossible in Europe.

The availability of so much cheap land did not guarantee that Virginia society would be more democratic than in England, and plantation agriculture based on tobacco led to slavery. The availability of labor determined how much tobacco could be produced in Virginia, while in England the amount of land owned by a farmer was the limiting factor for production."


"The concept of frontier is often confused with a bright-line boundary, an edge between two places. In descriptions of colonial Virginia, the term 'frontier' is often used from just the point of view of the English culture. Fur traders penetrated into the 'backcountry,' the territory beyond the frontier. As the colonial population expanded, Native American cultures were forced to surrender land, pushing back the 'frontier.'"

## [Confederate Flag](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/06/pride-and-prejudice-the-americans-who-fly-the-confederate-flag) ##
"A listening tour in Mississippi asks flag supporters why they still support a symbol that represents pain, division and difficult history"
by Donna Ladd with pictures by Kate Medley

“'Effie, it’s just been a bad day,' the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. 'I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.'

The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.

'What did he do?' Effie Luby asked.

'He raped and killed a white woman.'"

"The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.

To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called 'liberalism'; to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at 'pro-white' rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial divides."

"The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.

The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the 'lost cause' of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a **'romanticized'** version of the war’s purpose.

By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled; in front of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.)

The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, division and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it."


"'The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,' Ira says. '… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!' he says."

"'Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,' the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over 'states’ rights' to financial independence; the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset; northern tariffs were killing the south; few southerners and soldiers owned humans; slavery was fading anyway; and it wasn’t about white supremacy."

"I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept."


"By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s 'Black Republicans' adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln 'preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.'"


"Massey, who identifies as more “Blackfoot-Cherokee” than white, isn’t interested in military history, saying the flag celebrates her heritage as a southerner, period. She grew up in Red Bay, Alabama, in a former slave region that the last census showed as 93% white and 1% black.

'We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,' she says."


“'It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,' she says."


"Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an 'inanimate object,' adding: 'Stop letting it control you.'

'If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.

The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls 'just a piece of cloth'.

'It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,' Be says."


"Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.

Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.

'To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,' Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were 'dirt-poor farmers' with no slaves."


"We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells 'adult novelties' and Confederate tchotchkes.

If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room."


"Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to divide them from people with shared economic interests.

'The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial division to maintain economic control,' the NAACP president says."


"The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.

'The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,' he says. 'Enjoy.'"


"'The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,' I say as she listens intently. 'But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist. Many people were taught certain things.'"


## [Confederate Flag in Popular Culture - Americana or Racist Symbol](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/22/confederate-flag-pop-culture-harmless-americana-racist-symbol) ##

"For a long time the flag was a touchstone for everyone from Primal Scream to the Dukes of Hazzard, but the Charleston murders have brought the American south’s iconic symbol under new scrutiny.

In the pop artist Larry Rivers’s haunting 1959 painting The Last Civil War Veteran, a man lies on his death bed under the flags of both the Confederacy and the Union. It is one of a series of works in which Rivers depicts the Confederate flag as a piece of Americana, a totem of history, a pop icon. He is far from the only artist to have used it in this way.

As the flag of the old American south comes under scrutiny for being an image of – and maybe an incitement to – racism and murderous bigotry, it is worth remembering that for a long time it has had a more ambiguous, apparently innocent reputation in popular culture.

No one accused the Dukes of Hazzard of white suprematism when the good ol’ boys who had a rollicking time in the 1970s TV series flaunted the starred diagonals of the flag that has become famous as the “Confederate battle flag” on their Dodge Charger. Similarly, no one has taken issue with its appearance everywhere from a Primal Scream album cover, which used a photograph of the stars without bars by William Eggleston, to Matt Groening’s self-parodic appearance as a flag-waving, far-right propagandist in The Simpsons (the joke being that it’s the opposite of the truth).

The Confederate flag suddenly looks like a starkly, horribly political totem, but can a flag have only one meaning? It is not even completely authentic: in reality, the southern states had several flags in the civil war, and the famous image is just part of a battery of original insignia, reduced in memory to one. Back when Larry Rivers was exploring it as a pop art icon, Jasper Johns made his great image of the Union flag with layers of collaged newsprint under its wax-painted stars and bars. In Flag, Johns captures the many stories hidden within nationhood. Flags are complex documents.

It is reasonable now to wonder if the Confederate flag is pure racist imagery, but its widespread cultural use would suggest it is more complicated than that. It also raises a bigger question. Is white southern identity itself something that needs to be abandoned or condemned? The proud cultural history of the south embraces everything from Jack Daniels and country music to the novels of William Faulkner and paintings of Cy Twombly – can that cultural richness be dismissed as archaic conservative nostalgia, or worse?

In reality, the struggle between regressive prejudices and human decency in the south has long been fought within its cultural traditions, not against them. The obvious example is country music. Robert Altman’s portrayal of country as a cynical conservative style in his film Nashville now looks like a hopelessly ignorant view of a tradition that includes radical voices like Steve Earle and Townes van Zandt.

The white American south has kept some of its most pestilential prejudices intact since the civil war. But it is not racist to drink bourbon, listen to Texas outlaw music or eat crabcakes, and it may not be racist to display a flag. In the end, it is just a piece of cloth."

"Much like some claim that the religion of Islam has been distorted and misused by some radical groups so is the case with this flag. Once the symbol of a misguided attempt to form a nation of slave holding states it is now been appropriated by hate groups, anti-government types, and militia types. So just as politicians call for those in mainstream Islam to denounce those who distort its tenets than so should they call for this flag to be put away and for strong statements to be made by white Southern Baptists Church leaders of their disgust for those groups and their use of this symbol. The nation it represented was defeated both on the battlefield and by choosing a path against human dignity. The flag belongs in museum as a reminder that people can find all kinds of ways to try to legitimize oppression even forming a central government and associated banner when hypocritically speaking of states rights."


## [Confederate Railroad - Crashing Symbols](https://www.oneillinois.com/stories/2019/7/10/crashing-symbols) ##
"Two flags: one a symbol of the nascent nation, the other a symbol of the insurgent Confederacy that declared itself independent only to be dragged back into the union in the Civil War. It seems simple enough. They’re just flags, after all. What’s the offense?

They’ve both become loaded with significance, that’s what, and many Illinoisans take offense over what they’ve come to represent.

The Confederate stars and bars is a symbol of pride to many in the South, to be sure. But that raises the question, what exactly are people proud of when they display that flag? Southern resilience? A particularly Southern spirit of ornery independence? Outright rebellion? Slavery?

 It’s a loaded symbol, and to many it’s genuinely fearsome, representing not only slavery, but those who would assert white supremacy today."
 
 “The Confederate flag is a symbol of the hate, oppression, and enslavement of African Americans. It was flown over states that committed treason and started a war — so that they could keep enslaving people. Hundreds of thousands were slaughtered in this fight over whether the nation should allow slavery or end it. Abraham Lincoln’s assassin was a disciple of the Confederacy. In short, the Confederate flag symbolizes slavery and the rebellion against the United States, and it is exactly what our state’s greatest son, President Lincoln, was fighting against. This symbol of hate, oppression, and bloodshed is categorically different from political satire.”

## [150 Years Ago, The Homestead Act Transformed the West](https://www.hcn.org/wotr/how-150-years-ago-the-homestead-act-transformed-the-west) ##
"All across forests of the West, 10-by-12-foot cabins stand forlorn and forgotten, many with tumbledown roofs and gaping doors. Yet these modest homesteads represent a revolution in public-land policy: They were the culmination of an American dream born of Thomas Jefferson’s belief that at our best, we would become a nation of independent farmers.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the fruit of Jefferson’s conviction -- the 1862 Homestead Act. The federal law changed the West forever by providing a new start for urban emigrants, immigrant families and single women.

Passed by Congress in 1862, during the Civil War, the Homestead Act celebrates one of the great settlement opportunities in world history. Only a young, brawny nation like the United States would be able, or willing, to give away free land.

Congress realized Jefferson’s dream when it voted to provide 160 acres, a quarter section, of free land, for anyone willing to live on it for five years, plant crops and build a cabin 10 by 12 feet in size to “prove up” their claim. In the American West, 57 percent of homesteaders made good on their claims for 600,000 patents on 80 million acres of what had been public domain.  The lure of free land drew American emigrants in covered wagons as well as European immigrants who crossed oceans and took railroads west.

Blake Bell, historian at the Homestead National Monument of America in Nebraska, notes that the Homestead Act “transformed the United States and the world as millions of lives were forever impacted by the government’s distribution of free land.”

A remarkable feature of this uniquely American law was its openness. The law did not require that homesteaders be American citizens, or even that homesteaders be men. Any adult could take up free land in the West, and dozens of single mothers tried their hand at homesteading.

The Homestead Act became wildly popular, and over the decades different versions of the law would be passed, such as the Timber Culture Act (1873), the Desert Land Act (1877), the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, a stock-grazer’s law where ranchers could own the surface but the federal government kept the minerals, and even a special homestead law for World War I veterans. Between 1862 and 1934, when the Taylor Grazing Act greatly diminished homesteading, 4 million land grants averaging 160 acres were made in 30 states.

Of course, fraud flourished.  Conniving ranchers sent their cowboys to homestead key springs and land along creeks. Tales are told of homesteaders swearing on the Bible that they had built a 10-by-12 cabin, without admitting that it was only 10-by-12 inches. Brothers sought adjoining claims and built one cabin straddling 320 acres instead of separate cabins on 160 acres.

Most of the homesteads have long since been incorporated into larger farms or ranches. So it was exciting to find a family that still owns its ancestors’ original homestead of 160 acres, no more, no less. The land is located in the Wet Mountain Valley of Colorado, against the east side of the rugged Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

Named a Colorado Centennial Farm, it represents five generations of consecutive family ownership since Moritz and Matilde Brandenburg homesteaded the ground in 1880. Their land patent was signed by President Chester A. Arthur. Great-great-grandson John Brandenburg explained, “The ground here was like it was in Germany -- loamy soil. It was tough times to homestead. My parents almost lost the place during the Depression in the 1930s, when you couldn’t find a dollar.”

But while thousands of homestead families sold their claims and moved away, the Brandenburgs hung on. Now the land is under a conservation easement held by the San Isabel Land Protection Trust, which safeguards sweeping views of the Sangre de Cristo Range, white now with the first snows.  Brandenburg and his son, Ken, hope to keep their property in the family. As Ken says, “It’s our refuge.”

I grew up on a former homestead of 160 acres in southeast Colorado, attending high school on the High Plains, the short-grass prairie of songbirds, raptors, jackrabbits and grama grass. It was a place of vastness where I had a view as far as the eye could see.

The homesteading legacy that peopled the West endures. Though forlorn cabins, roofless against winter winds, stand empty today, those simple structures represent success for families starting fresh, thanks to the key law that settled the West."


## [The Homestead Act](Homestead Act: Primary Documents in American History) ##
"Enacted in 1862, the Homestead Act encouraged Western migration by offering settlers 160 acres of public land. This guide compiles Library of Congress digital materials, external websites, and a print bibliography."

"Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 20, 1862, the Homestead Act encouraged Western migration by providing settlers 160 acres of public land. In exchange, homesteaders paid a small filing fee and were required to complete five years of continuous residence before receiving ownership of the land. After six months of residency, homesteaders also had the option of purchasing the land from the government for $1.25 per acre. The Homestead Act led to the distribution of 80 million acres of public land by 1900."

"President Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the Homestead Act on May 20, 1862 granted Americans 160-acre plots of public land for the price a small filing fee. The Civil War-era act, considered one of the United States’ most important pieces of legislation, led to Western expansion and allowed citizens of all walks of life—including former slaves, women and immigrants—to become landowners."


"In a July 4, 1861 speech, Lincoln told the nation the purpose of America’s government was "to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial burdens from all shoulders and to give everyone an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life." He followed through with the passage of the Homestead Act, which remained active for 124 years until it was repealed in 1976, and resulted in 10 percent of U.S. land—or 270 million acres—to be claimed and settled.

The incentive to move and settled on western territory was open to all U.S. citizens, or intended citizens, and resulted in 4 million homestead claims, although 1.6 million deeds in 30 states were actually officially obtained. Montana, followed by North Dakota, Colorado and Nebraska had the most successful claims. Native Americans were forced from their lands and onto reservations to make way for homesteaders.

During a speech made in Ohio in February 1861, Lincoln said the act was “worthy of consideration, and that the wild lands of the country should be distributed so that every man should have the means and opportunity of benefiting his condition."


"Of course, there were those who took advantage of homesteading. According to the National Archives, a limited number of farmers and laborers could afford to build a farm, which included access to tools, crops, livestock and more.

“In the end, most of those who purchased land under the act came from areas quite close to their new homesteads (Iowans moved to Nebraska, Minnesotans to South Dakota, and so on),” the agency states. “Unfortunately, the act was framed so ambiguously that it seemed to invite fraud, and early modifications by Congress only compounded the problem. Most of the land went to speculators, cattlemen, miners, lumbermen, and railroads.”"


"Americans hold a certain image of the West and Great Plains: a vague concoction of pioneers in covered wagons, hardworking, honest farmers, and, of course, Little House on the Prairie. The Homestead Act (1862) garnered widespread interest in settling the U.S. West; it created the impression that anyone willing to work hard could eke out a living on their own property. Self-fashioned pioneers streamed over the prairie’s overland trails in an attempt to forge their own success on the frontier."


"Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 during the Civil War, the Homestead Act was the most comprehensive land distribution bill passed in the nineteenth century. Prior to the act, the U.S. government auctioned or sold public land in large lots that ordinary citizens could not afford to buy or manage. The Homestead Act ambitiously shifted land ownership and development towards average American citizens."


"During the Civil War Abraham Lincoln and his Republican majority passed a series of bills intended to develop the United States West, taking advantage of the fact that there was little competition after the South left Congress. These laws had been stymied during the Antebellum sectional crisis due to the issue of slavery in Western territories."


"The Homestead Act of 1862 stated that any current or future citizen, with a mere ten dollars, could claim a homestead of up to 160 acres of government land, and “improve” the land by putting it to use as a family plot. This meant erecting a dwelling and farming the soil for a period of five years. If the claimant did so for the allotted period, they could then gain ownership of their land free of charge. The act did not define what it meant to be the “head of a family,” save for an age restriction of twenty-one years if a single individual sought land, which made the Act egalitarian; it allowed African Americans, persecuted and famine-struck immigrants, and even women a chance to find freedom and success in the West. Although many of these settlers were not successful (due in part to expanding industrialization and the harsh climate of the Plains), the Homestead Act endured as the driving force for many Americans and immigrants seeking the “American dream,” as well as in exacerbating the strained relationship between the individual farmer and railroad companies who owned the majority of Western territory."


"Kansas: The Land of Promise for African Americans
In the Reconstruction South during the 1870s, volatile racism pushed former black slaves to seek refuge in the Midwest. Many took advantage of the Homestead Act as an opportunity to manage their own households through subsistence farming while forging new lives in the Midwest. The Homestead Act did not ask for an applicant’s race (it was assumed, at the time, applicants would all be white), so in order for historians to find African American homesteading family records in the National Archives, they must triangulate them with other sources."


"Exclusively Black Settlements
Several exclusively black settlements began to emerge in Kansas after the Homestead Act. The most well-known was a town called Nicodermus, established in 1877. Founded by land prospector W.R. Hill and advertised by black minister W.R. Smith to black communities throughout the south, the town steadily increased in size, and by 1880 over 100 people had settled there. As African Americans slowly became disheartened and disillusioned by the difficulty of homesteading, migration numbers tapered off. However, between the years of 1869 and 1879, 27,000 blacks moved to Kansas, and though few found the success they had been hoping for, a considerable number stayed, finding it a better alternative to the South. 10 An 1879 issue of the Topeka Colored Citizen stated: “Our advice…to the people of the South, Come West, Come to Kansas…in order that you may be free from the persecution of the rebels. If blacks come here and starve, all well. It is better to starve to death in Kansas than to be shot and killed in the South.” (24:41) In the end, the challenges of African American homesteaders mirrored those of other settlers: some persevered and stayed, while others went into debt and left, discouraged by an Act that they had hoped would bring them prosperity or, at the very least, a small pocket of land and a home to call their own."


## Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://www.history.com/topics/westward-expansion/lewis-and-clark) ##
"The Lewis and Clark Expedition began in 1804, when President Thomas Jefferson tasked Meriwether Lewis with exploring lands west of the Mississippi River that comprised the Louisiana Purchase. Lewis chose William Clark as his co-leader for the mission. The excursion lasted over two years: Along the way they confronted harsh weather, unforgiving terrain, treacherous waters, injuries, starvation, disease and both friendly and hostile Native Americans. Nevertheless, the approximately 8,000-mile journey was deemed a huge success and provided new geographic, ecological and social information about previously uncharted areas of North America."

"Most of the land Lewis and Clark surveyed was already occupied by Native Americans. In fact, the Corps encountered around 50 Native American tribes including the Shoshone, the Mandan, the Minitari, the Blackfeet, the Chinook and the Sioux.

Lewis and Clark developed a first contact protocol for meeting new tribes. They bartered goods and presented the tribe’s leader with a Jefferson Indian Peace Medal, a coin engraved with the image of Thomas Jefferson on one side and an image of two hands clasped beneath a tomahawk and a peace pipe with the inscription, “Peace and Friendship” on the other.

They also told the Indians that America owned their land and offered military protection in exchange for peace.

Some Indians had met “white men” before and were friendly and open to trade. Others were wary of Lewis and Clark and their intentions and were openly hostile, though seldom violent.

In August, Lewis and Clark held peaceful Indian councils with the Odo, near present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa, and the Yankton Sioux at present-day Yankton, South Dakota."

"They crossed through Montana and made their way to the Continental Divide via Lemhi Pass where, with Sacagawea’s help, they purchased horses from the Shoshone. While there, Sacagawea reunited with her brother Cameahwait, who hadn’t seen her since she was kidnapped."

"Lewis’ group took a shortcut north to the Great Falls of the Missouri River and explored Marias River—a tributary of the Missouri in present-day Montana—while Clark’s group, including Sacagawea and her family, went south along the Yellowstone River. The two groups planned to rendezvous where the Yellowstone and Missouri met in North Dakota."


"Lewis and Clark returned to Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1806 and shared their experiences with President Jefferson.

While they had failed to identify a coveted Northwest Passage water route across the continent, they had completed their mission of surveying the Louisiana Territory from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and did so against tremendous odds with just one death and little violence.

The Corps had traveled more than 8,000 miles, produced invaluable maps and geographical information, identified at least 120 animal specimens and 200 botanical samples and initiated peaceful relations with dozens of Native American tribes.

Both Lewis and Clark received double pay and 1,600 acres of land for their efforts. Lewis was made Governor of the Louisiana Territory and Clark was appointed Brigadier General of Militia for Louisiana Territory and a federal Indian Agent.

Clark remained well-respected and lived a successful life. Lewis, however, was not an effective governor and drank too much. He never married or had children and died in 1809 of two gunshot wounds, possibly self-inflicted. A few years later, Sacagawea died, and Clark became her children’s guardian."


## [New Frontiers: South and West](https://wwnorton.com/college/history/archive/resources/documents/ch19_01.htm) ##
"The end of the Civil War found Americans confronting two frontiers of opportunity: the devastated South and the untamed West. They were—and are—the most distinctive sections of the country, and both regions exerted a magnetic attraction for adventurers and entrepreneurs. In the postwar South, people set about rebuilding railroads, mills, stores, barns, and homes. In the process of such renewal, a strenuous debate arose over the nature of the "New South." Should it try to recreate the agrarian culture of the antebellum period? Or should it adopt the northern model of a more diversified economy and urban-industrial society? The debate was never settled completely, and as a result both viewpoints competed for attention throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. By 1900, the South remained primarily an agricultural region, but it also had developed a far-flung network of textile mills, railroad lines, and manufacturing plants.

African Americans in the former Confederacy often found themselves at the center of the economic and political debate in the "New South." By the end of the century, black leaders themselves were divided over the best course to follow. For his part, Booker T. Washington counseled southern blacks to focus on economic and educational opportunities at the expense of asserting their political and legal rights. Not so, declared W. E. B. Du Bois. He attacked Washington's "accommodationist" strategy and urged blacks to undertake a program of "ceaseless agitation" for political and social equality.

Controversy also swirled around the frenzied renewal of western settlement after the Civil War. During the century after 1865, fourteen new states were carved out of the western territories. To encourage new settlers, the federal government helped finance the construction of four transcontinental railroads, conquered and displaced the Indians, and sold public land at low prices. Propelled by a lust for land and profits, millions of Americans headed west across the Mississippi River to establish homesteads, stake out mining claims, and set up shop in the many "boom towns" cropping up across the Great Plains and in the Far West.

This postwar surge of western migration had many of the romantic qualities so often depicted in novels, films, and television. The varied landscape of prairies, rivers, deserts, and mountains was stunning. And the people who braved incredibly harsh conditions to begin new lives in the West were indeed courageous and tenacious. Cowboys and Indians, outlaws and vigilantes, farmers and herders populated the plains, while miners and trappers led nomadic lives in hills and backwoods.

But these familiar images of western life tell only part of the story. Drudgery and tragedy were as commonplace as adventure and success. Droughts, locusts, disease, tornadoes, and the erratic fluctuations of commody markets made life relentlessly precarious. The people who settled the trans-Mississippi frontier were in fact a diverse lot: they included women as well as men, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and European immigrants.

Many of the settlers were also blinded by short-sighted greed and prone to irresponsible behavior. In the process of "removing" the Indians, military forces sometimes exterminated them. By the 1890s there were only 250,000 Native Americans left in the United States. The feverish quest for quick profits also helped fuel a boom/bust economic cycle that injected a chronic instability into the society and politics of the region.

The history of the Old West is thus a much more complicated story than that conveyed through popular culture—or through the accounts of some historians. In 1893 the historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced his so-called frontier thesis. The process of taming and settling an ever-receding frontier, Turner declared, gave American culture its distinctive institutions, values, and energy. The rigors and demands of westward settlement, for example, helped implant in Americans their rugged individualism and hardihood, and such qualities helped reinforce the democratic spirit that set them apart from other peoples. "Up to our day," Turner said, "American history has been in large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development." He was both right and wrong. The frontier experience explains much about the development of American society, but not all."

## [The Wild West Meets the Southern Border](The Wild West Meets the Southern Border) ##
"The show is about to start, so we step into the O.K. Corral and find seats in the metal bleachers, among twenty or thirty spectators. The show itself goes over my head—Clantons, Earps, Clantons, Earps—but every single one of the many gunshots in the short performance makes me jump. Perhaps because I didn’t grow up in the U.S., Wild West reënactments evoke no nostalgia in me. When I ask American friends what they know about the reënactment world, most mumble something about the Civil War. Some were dragged as kids to a reënactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, which for the past twenty-five years has taken place annually at the site where the real battles were fought. Few people I come across know that there are more than fifty thousand Civil War reënactors in the country, members of a guild with strict hierarchies and distinctions. Tony Horwitz, in his book “Confederates in the Attic,” analyzes what he calls “a period rush,” the particular adrenaline-fuelled energy that comes with being fully immersed in an authentic re-creation. Authenticity is the yardstick in reënactment culture. A “farb” is a reënactor who doesn’t spend enough time or money on props and costumes. The most committed call themselves “living historians,” and the “hard-cores” among them sometimes go on spartanlike diets in order to resemble underfed nineteenth-century soldiers; others soak the buttons that they sew on their uniforms in urine, to generate just the right amount of rust."

"America was mythologizing, via tourism and pop culture, its still recent past, and there was plenty of material to work with. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, nickelodeons and dime novels had featured the “lawless towns” of the West, and stories of cowboys, saloons, gunfights, and outlaws had become part of the collective imagination. Then came television and Hollywood, to further consolidate the myths of the Wild West."

"Traywick is full of stories, a kind of Wizard of Oz of Tombstone, and the author of countless reënactment skits. He wrote the original O.K. Corral scene (and played Wyatt Earp for twenty years)."

"Traywick tells Pejk and Cantú a long story about beheadings in China and shows them pictures of decapitated men, while I browse in the bookstore. There’s a Confederate flag in the back, some Mayan masks and relics behind Traywick’s desk, a few dusty mariachi hats, many framed pictures of admirals and generals—among them Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—and a poster of Donald Trump dressed as a cowboy, with a gun under his belt, and the slogan 'Keeping America Safe Again.'"

"The mythos of the Wild West celebrates the spirit of those who sought to settle in a new land, domesticate its difficulties, and thrive. Why, I ask, is that spirit admired in some cases and condemned in others? Our Shakespeare guides protest that I’m conflating two different things. One case is 'historical' and the other is . . . not."

"Driving south, toward the border, we see no signs of crisis, no migrants, and few cars. We see a Border Patrol cam truck—a pickup with a surveillance camera mounted on a tall mast—and many commercial trucks, probably transporting commodities in and out of the country. The great paradox of the nafta agreement is that it has allowed for freer trade of merchandise across the border, and less freedom of movement for people."


"Shakespeare is in New Mexico. Tombstone, in Arizona. Both are old mining towns near the U.S.-Mexico border. They came into existence in the eighteen-seventies, during the silver strike, but soon suffered the same fate as most of the other mining towns in the region: boom, depression, abandonment, and then a strange kind of afterlife."

## [The Myth of the Cowboy](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/20/myth-of-the-cowboy) ##
"Our starting point is the fact that, in and outside Europe, the 'western' in its modern sense – that is, the myth of the cowboy – is a late variant of a very early and deep-rooted image: that of the wild west in general. Fenimore Cooper, whose popularity in Europe followed immediately upon his first publication – Victor Hugo thought he was 'the American Walter Scott' – is the most familiar version of this. Nor is he dead. Without the memory of Leatherstocking, would English punks have invented Mohican hairstyles?

The original image of the wild west, I suggest, contains two elements: the confrontation of nature and civilisation, and of freedom with social constraint. Civilisation is what threatens nature; and their move from bondage or constraint into independence, which constitutes the essence of America as a radical European ideal in the 18th and early 19th centuries, is actually what brings civilisation into the wild west and so destroys it. The plough that broke the plains is the end of the buffalo and the Indian.

In terms of literary pedigree, the invented cowboy was a late romantic creation. But in terms of social content, he had a double function: he represented the ideal of individualist freedom pushed into a sort of inescapable jail by the closing of the frontier and the coming of the big corporations. As a reviewer said of Frederic Remington's articles, illustrated by himself in 1895, the cowboy roamed 'where the American may still revel in the great red-shirted freedom which has been pushed so far to the mountain wall that it threatens soon to expire somewhere near the top'. In hindsight, the west could seem thus, as it seemed to that sentimentalist and first great star of movie westerns William S Hart, for whom the cattle and mining frontier 'to this country … means the very essence of national life … It is but a generation or so since virtually all this country was frontier. Consequently its spirit is bound up in American citizenship.' As a quantitative statement this is absurd, but its significance is symbolic. And the invented tradition of the west is entirely symbolic, inasmuch as it generalises the experience of a comparative handful of marginal people. Who, after all, cares that the total number of deaths by gunshot in all the major cattle towns put together between 1870 and 1885 – in Wichita plus Abilene plus Dodge City plus Ellsworth – was 45, or an average of 1.5 per cattle-trading season, or that local western newspapers were not filled with stories about bar-room fights, but about property values and business opportunities?

Is this Reaganite myth of the west an international tradition? I think not. In the first place because the major American medium by which the invented west was propagated has died out. The western novel, as I have suggested, is no longer an international phenomenon. The private eye has killed the Virginian. Larry McMurtry and his like, whatever their place in American literature, are virtually unknown outside their native country. As for the western movie, it was killed by TV; and the western TV series, which was probably the last genuinely international mass triumph of the invented west, became a mere adjunct to children's hour, and in turn it has faded away. Where are Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Laramie, Gunsmoke and the rest on which the kids of the 1950s thrived? The real western movie became deliberately highbrow, a carrier of social, moral and political significance in the 1950s, until it in turn collapsed under their weight as well as the advancing age of the makers and stars – of Ford and Wayne and Cooper. I'm not criticising them. On the contrary, practically all the westerns that any of us would wish to see again date from after Stagecoach (which was released in 1939). But what carried the west into the hearts and homes of five continents was not movies that aimed at winning Oscars or critical applause. What is more, once the late western movie had itself become infected by Reaganism – or by John Wayne as an ideologist – it became so American that most of the rest of the world didn't get the point, or, if it did, didn't like it.

In Britain, at least, the word 'cowboy' today has a secondary meaning, which is much more familiar than the primary meaning of a fellow in the Marlboro ads: a fellow who comes in from nowhere offering a service, such as to repair your roof, but who doesn't know what he's doing or doesn't care except about ripping you off: a 'cowboy plumber' or a 'cowboy bricklayer'. I leave you to speculate (a) how this secondary meaning derives from the Shane or John Wayne stereotype and (b) how much it reflects the reality of the Reaganite wearers of dude Stetsons in the sunbelt. I don't know when the term first appears in British usage, but certainly it was not before the mid-1960s. In this version, what a man's got to do is to fleece us and disappear into the sunset.

What was so special about cowboys? First, clearly, that they occurred in a country that was universally visible and central to the 19th-century world, of which it constituted, as it were, the utopian dimension: the living dream. Anything that happened in America seemed bigger, more extreme, more dramatic and unlimited, even when it wasn't – and of course often it was, though not in the case of the cowboys. Second, because the purely local vogue for western myth was magnified and internationalised by means of the global influence of American popular culture, the most original and creative in the industrial and urban world, and the mass media that carried it and which the US dominated. And let me observe in passing that it made its way in the world not only directly, but also indirectly, via the European intellectuals it attracted to the US, or at a distance.

This would certainly explain why cowboys are better known than vaqueros or gauchos, but not, I think, the full range of the international vibrations they set up, or used to set up. This, I suggest, is due to the in-built anarchism of American capitalism. I mean not only the anarchism of the market, but the ideal of an individual uncontrolled by any constraints of state authority. In many ways the 19th-century US was a stateless society. Compare the myths of the American and the Canadian west: the one is a myth of a Hobbesian state of nature mitigated only by individual and collective self-help: licensed or unlicensed gunmen, posses of vigilantes and occasional cavalry charges. The other is the myth of the imposition of government and public order as symbolised by the uniforms of the Canadian version of the horseman-hero, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

I don't think it was an accident that the ideal-typical cowboy hero of the classic invented west was a loner, not beholden to anyone; nor, I think, that money was not important for him. As Tom Mix put it: "I ride into a place owning my own horse, saddle and bridle. It isn't my quarrel, but I get into trouble doing the right thing for somebody else. When it's all ironed out, I never get any money reward.

In a way the loner lent himself to imaginary self-identification just because he was a loner. To be Gary Cooper at high noon or Sam Spade, you just have to imagine you are one man, whereas to be Don Corleone or Rico, let alone Hitler, you have to imagine a collective of people who follow and obey you, which is less plausible. I suggest that the cowboy, just because he was a myth of an ultra-individualist society, the only society of the bourgeois era without real pre-bourgeois roots, was an unusually effective vehicle for dreaming – which is all that most of us get in the way of unlimited opportunities. To ride alone is less implausible than to wait until that marshal's baton in your knapsack becomes reality."

## [Cowboys in Life and Legend](https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/cowboys/CBintro.htm) ##
"Etymologists trace the use of the term cowboy back to 1000 AD in Ireland. Swift used it in 1705, logically enough, to describe a boy who tends cows. Modern usage, first in hyphenated form, dates from the 1830s in Texas. Colonel John S. "Rip" Ford used the word cow-boy to describe the Texan border raider who drove off Mexican cattle during the 1830s. The term carried a tinge of wildness, of life at the fringes of law and 'civilization.' After the American Civil War, Westerners applied the term cowboy to ranch hands, rather than cattle thieves. 

The Denver Republican (October 1, 1883) observed that 'it matters not what age, if a man works on a salary and rides after the herd, he is called a 'cowboy.' A cowboy, then as now, is a man who works at least part of the year as a salaried ranch hand. Ranchers or 'cowmen' owned land and cattle; cowboys did not own land and seldom owned cattle.

The cowboy of the American West, a dashing figure in popular novels and films, was in reality a poorly paid laborer engaged in difficult, dirty, often monotonous work. During the years after the Civil War the range cattle industry spread northward from Texas. During the 1870s cowboying spread to the Southwest and the northern plains. Although some of the young men who worked on these ranches were from the northeastern states, a majority were probably southerners. Many had fought for the Confederacy. 

Cowboys branding cattle - RACE: Unlike most movie depictions, not all cowboys were white. Racial distribution varied from place-to-place. Mostly Anglo cowboys worked the Montana ranges. Further south, however, in Texas, for example, perhaps one-third of the hands may have been African-Americans or Mexican-Americans. 

Cowboys herding cattle - WORK LIFE: The Cowboy's work year centered on two big events, the roundup and the long drive. Roundups were held in the spring and often also in the fall. After cowboys had herded cattle to a central location, they branded newborn calves, castrated and dehorned older animals, and, in the spring, chose the cattle to be taken to market. 

From 1865 to 1880 at least 3.5 million cattle were driven in herds of between 1,500 and 3,000 from southern Texas to cattle towns on rail lines in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The route most frequently used was the Chisholm Trail which went to Abilene, Kansas. Working up to 20 hours a day, cowboys drove the animals from one watering place to the next. They had to guard against predators (two- and four-footed), straying cattle, and stampedes at night. For his hard and dirty work the typical cowboy earned between $25 and $40 a month. 

By about 1890 much of the range had been fenced. The westward extension of the railroads eliminated the need for the long cattle drives. The 'good old days' of epic drives and open range riding came to an end. At this point, however, dime novels wild west shows, and books such as Owen Wister's The Virginian (1902) offered the nostalgic public a stalwart, romantic cowboy hero. Although far removed from the drab truth, the image of excitement, freedom, and drama continues to dominate popular accounts of the cattle frontier. 

Cowboys bedding down for the night - VIEWS OF THE COWBOY: The cowboy generated conflicting appraisals. When observed at the end of a long trail drive, 'hellin' 'round town," cowboys attracted little praise. The Topeka Commonwealth (August 15, 1871), painted an unflattering portrait of the cowboy on a tear.

Cowboys were no paragons of virtue, as many romantics and popularizers would have it. Nor were they the uncouth barbarians of the plains described by self-anointed spokesmen of civilization and culture. Externalities--principally the law and employers--imposed restrictions that shaped their lives. But cowboys lived as much as possible by their own internal codes of conduct. The cardinal virtues for the American cowboy were to do his best and to be cheerful, courageous, uncomplaining, helpful, and chivalrous. Of course, few cowboys maintained these ideals at all times in their lives."

## [The Myth of the Literary Cowboy, Part 1: Peculiarly American](https://blog.pshares.org/the-myth-of-the-literary-cowboy-part-1-peculiarly-american/) ##
"Being raised in West Texas, I have experience with cowboys. I’ve taught and been taught by them, worked with them, listened to their poetry, and eaten their food. My cowboys are the real, working men who get their hands dirty, but have never (to my knowledge) been in a shoot out. This, however, does not diminish my love for their literary counterparts: the lean silhouette against a sunset, hat tipped, cigarette dangling, gun at hip. Whether L’Amour or McMurtry, Shane or Cool Hand Luke, Gunsmoke or Deadwood, I, like most Americans, have grown up with the cowboy, a unique character spun from the past that has become part of our mythology.

After the Civil War smoke cleared, America was challenged with not just rebuilding the nation, but constructing a new national identity that favored neither North nor South. Rather, the call was for a cohesive story for the future that could overcome war-time grudges and fit into a singular American identity. In 1901, Theodore Roosevelt, a man who built his image on cowboy masculinity, gave America a place to look for this new culture in his “Manhood and Statehood” speech: '[This] Republic will find its guidance in the West, because the conditions of development in the West have steadily tended to accentuate the peculiarly American characteristics of its people.'

These peculiar characteristics would find their home against backdrop of the neutral West, with the cowboy a hero the divided country could root for. Despite a general dislike of British traditions during this time, writers like Owen Wister and Zane Grey sculpted the cowboy from the central figure of the British knight in popular tales of King Arthur and Robin Hood.

During my graduate Arthurian Literature course, we were asked about the survival of knighthood chivalry in the the American cowboy. Pregnant at the time, I gave an emotional answer about the cowboys I knew, like a man at work who was so concerned I wouldn’t have a ride to the hospital due to my husband’s work schedule, he insisted on giving me his home phone number (he also brought me pie every week).

On a literary level, comparing the two had not crossed my mind until then, but the similarities are evident. Horse-reliant wanderers, they are symbols of gallantry and masculinity forged during times of social and economic change. The cowboy rode out of the Civil war; the knight rose to popularity in the waning years of feudalism. Beyond a military figure, the literary knight was romanticized with a chivalric code, and became a dispenser of justice and bringer of order.

Similarly, the American cowboy character, removed from the actual vocation (and not to be confused with other cowboy types such as the vaquero, gaucho, or buaso), represented an ideal separate from the feudalistic South and industrial North — Anglo, stoic, spiritual, self-reliant, and detached from the corruptions of society. As with the knight, the cowboy was tasked with settling the West and maintaining order in whatever way he might define it. The West became a place of black hats and white hats where moral order reined above all else. On that front, while the knight might answer to a king, the cowboy answered only to himself (and God), allowing him, like America, to construct his own rules and identity, a prime example of the “American Adam” described by R.W.B. Lewis.

The cowboy also owes his construction to exaggerated legends of real, still-living men. The existence of a historical Arthur or Robin Hood warrant continued debate; men like Jesse James and Wyatt Earp not only existed, but achieved celebrity because their exploits were sensationalized in newspapers and dime novels, blurring the line between fact and fiction, folk tale and journalism. Wild West shows became the stomping ground for those swept up in the romance of the fictionalized West, selling the American people its lawlessness as entertainment. Controlled and bereft of real danger, it allowed people to experience the lifestyle from a safe distance that kept the image intact.

With time, the cowboy would add singer, poet, and entertainer to his list of achievements, the character appearing in multiple mediums while still maintaining the basic elements developed by those early writers. Like Arthurian lore, the cowboy would be redefined and rebuilt each generation, at once thoroughly American yet malleable for stories representing a wildness and code of living, no matter the time or place.

Part of the continuing appeal might be the paradox of morality—the cowboy’s untamed toughness is tempered with personal ethics that make him a moral equalizer, a purveyor of justice outside the law. Because this can best be tested in places where wildness still exists, it makes sense that the cowboy of today is often sent into space for a Woody meets Buzz Lightyear smashup of tradition and technology. No matter his location, the literary cowboy will never truly be tamed. His rejection of the societal trappings is crucial, as he is not part of any specific social class. In fact, attempts to civilize him end poorly (or comically as the story calls for it).

The literary figure of the cowboy might have been constructed as a part of nationalist sentiment, but he has come to represent an ideology that is inseparable from America (as evidenced by the many times Team USA athletes have entered an Olympic stadium in cowboy hats). Perhaps because the cowboy icon is such a part of our culture, he cannot be assigned to any other nationality, and he continues to garner invitations to the range of imagination. In the coming months, I will be walking through the cowboy’s peculiarly American history in literature from his development in Wister’s The Virginian to his deconstruction in recent years on the page and screen.

"Last time on Myth of the Literary Cowboy, our hero was developed from the English knight as a post-Civil War appeal to nationalism, and my husband discovered I withheld pie a few years ago.

While the cowboy is inspired by the knight, however, he is his own man, one defined by characteristics that have become part of American pop culture. Dime novels and real life heroes sparked the imagination, but it was the novel of one man that gave us a literary blueprint for how to make a cowboy: Owen Wister’s The Virginian.

Made most famous by Gary Cooper on the big screen and James Drury on the small, The Virginian has numerous adaptations. The novel, written in 1902, created Westerns as we know them, taking them out of the cheap realm of pulp novels and into their own literary genre. Wister combined several Western-set short stories with elements of Arthurian literature, mixed in a romance, and seasoned it with a dash of Theodore Roosevelt, to whom the novel is dedicated.

A cowboy known only as the Virginian leads the inexperienced, unnamed narrator through the wilds of Wyoming to Judge Henry’s ranch in Sun Creek, where the story focuses on the Virginian’s life in the lawless West. The story contains all the elements we have come to expect in a Western: love, hate, revenge, friendship, action, and violence.

At the core of the story is the Virginian, who would be the literary cowboy model for decades to come. In a 1988 New York Times article, Larry McMurtry, who is the most noteworthy shaper of Western literature in the past fifty years, named himself “a critic of the myth of the cowboy.” I would agree, but I would also argue that in order to criticize, he still relies on the pattern established by Wister. (I would not, however, argue this to his face. He wore jeans to collect his Academy Award—I don’t mess with that kind of swagger.) McMurtry, Grey, McCarthy, L’Amour, and a passel of others may twist, deify, or deconstruct the cowboy, but there are some fundamentals that define their characters as cowboys thanks to Mr. Wister and his Virginian.

Mad Horse Skills

In 1956, Disney created an animated short called “A Cowboy Needs a Horse.” The song by George Bruns (which I might guess is part of Texas preschool curriculum; both my kids have learned it) begins with the film’s title, clearly pointing out the horse as rudimentary part of a cowboy’s life. This is one of those elements that harkens back to the knight; after all, neither can ride the country-side righting wrongs without a noble steed. The Virginian is even subtitled The Horseman of the Plains, and our first view of the Virginian is roping a pony with ease—after which it becomes evident that he has a special way with horses, so much so that he woos his future wife through riding lessons. Monte, his own mount, is by his side for the majority of novel.

Self-Made

The West was viewed as a land of opportunity where people could build their own destinies. Cowboys are the personification of that desire. Even if they come from wealth or status, they reject those traditions to construct their own destinies. The Virginian left home at 14 because he disagreed with his family. We know little else of his past except that he does not return to his family, as they no longer understand him. His ties to his past are irrelevant. On the merit of his skills and hard work he is made the ranch foreman. Not satisfied with life as a simple horseman, the Virginian reads works of literature, showing a preference for Shakespeare. His mind, identity, and moral code are his own to define.

Moral

Speaking of the moral code, the Virginian showcases this shining characteristic of the cowboy. Later television incarnations would amp up the white hat/black hate view of the West, but Wister presents the complex justice of cowboy morality. Perhaps one of the novel’s most profound subplots centers on the Virginian hanging a group of cattle rustlers which includes his one-time friend, Steve. Many, most notably the Virginian’s love Molly, call him a murderer. He stands by his actions and eventually the Judge supports his proceedings, arguing that in the absence of government action, people must become the enforcers.  By exploring Western law in this way, Wister develops the image of the gun and the cowboy as the balance of right in the untamed (and often crooked) wilderness. The cowboy then must define justice for himself and defend right in the face of corruption.

Masculine

The West is no place for guy liner and androgyny. Like Roosevelt, the Virginian is a picture of masculinity, one who showcases leadership skills which eventually lead him to be made foreman of the Judge’s ranch. He has the respect of his fellow cowboys (who he can also joke with) and the admiration of ladies. He’s a man’s man, physically and mentally sturdy, with an equally strong moral character and stoicism. The narrator, upon viewing a collection of cowboys at the beginning of Chapter 3, notes “In their flesh our natural passions ran tumultuous; but often in their spirit sat hidden a true nobility, and often beneath its unexpected shining their figures took on heroic structure.” Which leads us to . . .

Brave

As with the knights and epic heroes, the cowboy must be brave. We know the Virginian is brave because we are told so by a dealer who claims only cowards are dangerous with guns as they’ll “always go shooting before it’s necessary.” Courageous men like the Virginian will only shoot when all else fails and never out of fear. By the time the Virginian shoots, the dealer asserts, “it’d be too late” to worry. Not only does this digression comment on the nature of the cowboy, it provides foreshadowing for the climax of the book when the Virginian does enter into a duel to defend his honor, and his enemy, a coward who has shadowed him throughout the book, has left him no other options.

Good with a Gun

Like any good hero, the Virginian must be tested by a villain. In this case that scoundrel is Trampas, who is established early in the novel as an enemy when he calls the Virginian a “son-of-a—” during a card game. The Virginian’s response, “When you call me that, smile,” sets in motion a five-year vendetta that culminates in a showdown.

The gunfight might be Wister’s most important contribution to the cowboy. To truly be a cowboy, the character must be a skilled gunfighter. Whether or not he uses those skills depends on the circumstances. But they must be present, at the ready to burn rivals when all else fails so that justice may win the day.

The cowboy is a complex individual who could warrant a whole book of analysis. These fundamentals are just the highlights of this American favorite. Tune in next time as we take a gander at the television and film cowboys who rode across the screen and into America’s hearts."

## [The Darker Side of Dixie: Southern Music and the Seamier Side of the Rural South](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11911&context=rtd) ##
"This study investigates several issues in southern culture that have here to fore been largely ignored. Music has been, and still is, a major force in southern society, and for hundreds of years this mode of communication has reflected regional ideas as much as any social institution. In order for music to reflect southern culture, it must first speak the language of the region, exhibit regional cultural attributes, and accept thedistinctivecharacteristicsoftheSouth. By so doing, music becomes culturally accepted and, therefore, it reinforces the messages, the opinions,andtheideasofsouthernsociety. This study examines some of the rural cultural themes utilized in southern music. The principal cultural topics to be analyzed include racism, domestic violence, male control over women, drunkenness, brutality, murder, gun ownership, Confederate symbolism,folk justice, and family honor. Since these themes are evident in folk music, early blues tunes, post-World War II country lyrics, and southern rock and roll of the late twentieth century, music illustrates the continuity of southern culture."

"This was especially true when a family member had been the victim. In the late twentieth century, for example, when Charlie Daniels called for lynchings, and 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' and when Hank Williams Or claimed that he was going to shoot the man who killed his family, both artists sounded similar to the rural mountain balladeers of the nineteenth century. Not much had changed. In the eyes of these performers, vigilantism worked, and it should be used. Moreover, this study will explore other topics, such as illegal drug use, which have not been major themes in southern music. By doing so, it will address the question whether those southern African Americans who migrated to northern urban areas prior to the World War II deserved to be labeled cocaine fiends, or whether this was a racial stereotype created by northern whites."

"Musical lyrics are of value to historians because they are cultural artifacts of a community and a culture that allow scholars to examine the issues, problems, values, and ideas of the time period in which the lyrics were written. When dealing with gender issues, for example, song lyrics are excellent historical tools because they portray gender roles that illustrate how both males and females think and act, or are expected to act, within a given culture. The study of these kinds of lyrics are also important because the words demonstrate how southern men dealt with gender issues. Since musical lyrics reflect cultural attitudes, if the culture of the rural South approved of the domination of women by men, and if southern men physically abused women, these themes will appear in the region's
music."

"They should pick cotton instead of guitar strings."

"Besides exploring domestic violence and gender control, this study will also examine how rural southerners responded to other important issues. During the Civil War and Reconstruction eras, for example, what were the major southern symbols, and how did southern songsters deal with losing this all-important war? Music allows scholars to determine if the common people were apologetic or unrepentant. Similarly, in the late nineteenth century how did folk balladeers deal with the increased rates of raciallynchings? Whodidtheyblamefortheseacts,thevictimsorthe victimizers? Howdidtheyexplainthebrutalmutilationsandexecutionsof African American males? By omitting certain realities, did these musicians promote racial hate? Furthermore, in this era of high murder rates, how did southerners view their murderous world? When someone was killed, who or what did they blame? Similarly, were the people shocked, or did they simply consider brutality a regrettable but indubitable fact of southern life? Moreover,how did African American and white women deal differently with domestic violence? Is it significant that in blues songs African American women often grabbed a firearm and fought back, but in folk music Caucasian women usually begged for mercy?"

"Despite growing industrialization and urbanization, the myth of the rural South also survived in popular imagination."

"In that regard, this work will examine the responsibility southern music had for the survival of the region's rural image that still haunts southerners today. Moreover, it will analyze how southern males historically compared themselves to northern males. In the late twentieth century,for example,did southern redneck rock groups, like their nineteenth-century predecessors, still push the archaic notions that not only could any southern man"

"Finally, when modern country and rock musicians flaunted Confederate symbolism, were they only telling everyone that they were proud to be
southerners? In the 1970s, for example, why did Georgia crowds go berserk when Lynyrd Skynyrd's lead singer, Ronnie Van Zant, waved a Confederate flag and screamed out, '01e' Neil Young should remember that a southern man don't need him around, anyhow?' Southern music gives scholars a unique insight into these, and many other, important social questions."

"Moreover, video tapes of old southern musical shows enable historians to comprehend the excitement audiences exhibited for particular songs. A 1969 episode of 'Del Reeves' Country Carnival,' for example, illustrates this splendidly. When Reeves sang 'Are You From Dixie,' the audience, composed of males and females in their mid-forties, were energized. Similarly, southerners went wild when Johnny Cash yelled out, in his first hit tune 'Ha Porter,' that he had to 'get back' to the South, so that he could 'plant my feet on southern soil, and breath that southern air.' Similarly, modern concert performances by such southern groups as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Alabama, Black Oak Arkansas, and Hank Williams Jr. offer scholars valuable insight into the culture. A teach of their concerts Confederate symbolism emerged as a major theme.'"

"Therefore, many southern groups, such as Confederate Railroad and Molly Hatchet, have used southern emblems, such as the Confederate Flag, on their jackets to increase sales."

"These artists were not only popular, but they also either sang songs that reflected the culture or stressed their southerness. On most of its albums,tapes,videos,and compact disks,for example, Alabama usually included several numbers that either glorified or romanticized the South."

"Unlike the earlier rockers, these southern males were not only belligerent, but they always emphasized their southern roots. These
men, for example, continually claimed that a southerner could 'beat the hell' out of anybody. In fact, most pushed southerness to the extreme."

"Many bands told young southerners to be proud of their history."

"Unlike Elvis, these whiskey-soaked, macho-acting, southern males also gathered fans and sold millions of albums by reverting to old negative southern themes, such astheConfederacy,racism,whiskey,guns,andviolence, Afewofthemost prominent bands in this category included Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, Black Oak Arkansas, The Charlie Daniels Band, .38 Special, The Marshall Tucker Band, The Ozark Mountain Daredevils, ZZ Top, The Allman Brothers, and The Outlaws."

"a very dark side to southern rural music"

"Instead of being only a happy and positive place, this music illustrates that for generations racism, sexism, vigilantism, hate, violence, crime, alcoholism, murder, and poverty have been significant aspects of southern society."

"In retrospect, although not every person residing in the South would approve of all the themes outlined in this study (not every southerner, for example, hates homosexuals, holds firm to fundamentalism, believes in white supremacy, or thinks that a real man has to be a rugged fighter), music
reflects that such ideas have been culturally significant."

"It would be foolish to claim that men only killed or beat women in the South."

"This is culturally significant, because it indicates that gender and control was deeply ingrained in southern culture."

"Because few historical sources deal with the killing of southern women, particularly the rural poor of both races, music offers scholars a unique insight into this hidden problem. Pre-World War II femicide lyrics are of value to historians because they are cultural artifacts of a community and culture that allow scholars to have an unobtrusive look into the issues, values, and ideas of the time period in which the lyrics were written. When dealing with gender issues,such as femicide, song lyrics are excellent historical tools because they portray gender roles that illustrate how both males and females thought and acted, or were expected to behave, within a given culture. The study of southern femicide lyrics is also important because the words demonstrate how some southern men dealt with women when certain gender specific situations arose, such as adultery and pre-martial pregnancy. Of course,not every souther nmale killed or even sanctioned the slaying of women. In fact,it would be foolish and historically irresponsible to claim that every man who caught his wife in the act of adultery, murdered her. Music, however, is useful because it does indicate that such ideas were firmly established in the region's intellectual mind-set."

"Even though females have been murdered throughout American society, on certain occasions southern culture sanctioned its use more than other areas of the country. Between 1882 and 1927, for example, ninety-two women were lynched in the UnitedStates."

"In fact,historican Dickerson D. Bruce Jr., pointed out that in the nineteenth-century South, violence was viewed as 'an essential fact of human life some how built into human relationships." 

"In addition to being lynched, burned at the stake, and killed in race riots, in the post-Civil War era African American females were simply 'just murdered.'" 

In such an environment, music reflects that both black and white women were killed. Similarly, both black and white folk songs show the extent of lethal violence against southern women in the pre-World War II era. In fact, no matter how sensational these folk songs might appear to contemporary observers, in the past rural southerners did not find the stories inconceivable. When the songs dealt with vicious female homicides they discussed events that occurred. Most of the local folktunes were indeed factual."

"The most violent act that can be committed is murder, and imported folk ballads that described the killing of women were often more popular in the South than in other sections of the United States. These tunes entered the region via a wide variety of non-North American locations, including England, Scotland, and Norway, as well as several non-southern North American sites. Although the songs originated from different locales, they were popular with both African American and white rural southerners from the Florida Everglades to the Ozark mountains"

"According to scholars such as Michael E. Bush, female murder tunes were popularintheSouth. They were a major part of the oral tradition. In fact, imported murder ballads that depicted the murdering of women were found in every southern state."

"Although not every imported femicide song was popular throughout the South, several such violent ballads and their numerous variations were prevalent in one or more southern states. These violent tunes were popular with rural southern audiences for several reasons. Chiefly, rural southerners identified with the message, because as many scholarly studies have shown, murder was an integral part of the culture. Since, according to several music scholars, only songs that mirrored some essential element of southern culture survived in the region's oral tradition, it is important to analyze which events remained unchanged in imported femicide tunes. What was the crucial element in these songs that enabled them to endure in the South, sometimes for generations after they ceased to be sung in Europe, while other tunes simply faded from the region's collective memory? First and foremost, although several southern versions of a particular
female murder ballad might differ in tone or location, one thing always remained the same--a woman was killed. By examining the femicidal ballads Appalachian whites sang, it became apparent that material not essential to themurderdidnotsurvive. Similarly, in the Virginia version of the Scottish number 'Jellon Grame'," the central theme, the killing of the woman, stayed, but the Scottish dialect and uncommon words were changed or omitted. Because femicides occurred in the region, southern ballad singers did not change that aspect of the tune. Rural southern audiences under stood that when certain situations arose, males could and did kill females."

Southern femicide tunes are excellent historical sources, because they enable scholars to cut beneath the facade of southern life and see how southern society treated and viewed women. They indicate, for example, that a paternalistic society existed in the South. In fact,they prove that southern culture even condoned the use of lethal violence to control women. This can best be seen in adultery songs. Not only are these tunes filled with deadly violence, but they also reflect that southern males sanctionedthisviolentbehavior. Several southern states have had, and some parts of the region still do have, unwritten laws that allow a man to kill his unfaithful wife."

"Adultery songs are interesting because they show that southern males often believed that it was justifiable homicide to kill women that committed adultery."

"In Lawrence County, Kentucky, during the late 1890s, a similar murder occurred when Lucy Adams was shot and killed by her husband. He found her with another man, Ande Kitchen. Not only was her husband, Jesse, acquitted in court, but an interesting song of the events was written. This particular tune again demonstrates that southern culture justified such behavior. First, the community where the killing occurred. Brushy Fork, maintained thatKitchen 'must die.'"

"The brutal treatment of unfaithful women was not only a white southernattribute. In southern history African American females have been lynched and burned at the stake for no apparent reason, thus, it is not surprisingthattheywerealsokilledforadultery. Lyrically,when African American women ran away from their husbands but then begged to be reunited,they were frequently beaten."

"In black and white tunes the message is clear: women were warned that adultery could lead to death. These songs indicate that both blacks and whites believed that female infidelity was a serious cultural taboo. These songs also reveal that when culturally unacceptable events provoked southern males to commit murder, the community forgave the male killer and chastised his female victim. Although each song had its own particular twist, one thing almost always remained the same: women who cheated on their husbands invariably died, or at the very least were savagely beaten."

"Instead of only reflecting the cultural views southern society had towards women who committed adultery, these tunes are also meaningful because they show how the culture perceived males. While both black and white southern men who killed their adulterous lovers were glamorized in the music, men who did nothing about such relationships were depicted as culturaloutcasts,notheroes. In one folk song, 'May I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight, Mister?,' a man who did not punish his adulterous wife became a 'tramp' looking for pity and a place to stay on a stormy night."

"In both African American and white southern songs murdering males were romanticized, while less aggressive men were scorned. These tunes demonstrate that southern culture had no sympathy for males who did not react violently when their female family members, who were supposed to be under male control, disregarded cultural norms."

"It is blatant sexual exploitation when a man kills a woman simply because she refuses his marriage proposal."

"These kinds of songs are important to understanding gender relations in the South, but to fully understand the topic of female control in southern murder songs historians must consider why men also died in these tunes. Scholars cannot contend, for example, that because adulterous black and white males were also killed, these types of murder songs only demonstrate that a powerful fundamentalist morality was in force throughout the rural South. Instead of portraying religious morality, feminist scholars maintain such murders demonstrate that males controlled females. It does not matter if the homicide was committed by a jealous husband, father, or brother because the 'same complex of control and male authority is involved when men kill men because of jealousy and possessiveness'"

"Like oral history sources, these songs indicate that male family members were expected to kill white women and their lovers for being promiscuous. Second, these tunes portray men who did not kill such women as cowards and bums. As a result these tunes show that a patriarchal society, based on lethal force, existed in the South. These tunes indicate that above all else, southern males believed that women had to be controlled, even if that meant committing murder. In fact, the continual emergence of these themes shows that such ideas were thoroughly embedded in southern culture."

"These sadistic songs help scholars understand gender relationships in southern culture. First and foremost,they show that when dealing with women, males could be brutal. Second, according to criminologists, the use of excessive violence indicates that the men consciously determined to kill their female victims. Third, and on a deeper psychological level, these songs mentioned excessive violence in order to intimidate women. According to Kate Millett, patriarchal societies use violence and the threat of it to keep control. This form of terror is attempted to keep women from gaining any control over their lives. This is evident when considering that the horrible deaths generally followed some sort of deed done by a woman, usually indications of premarital sex or adultery, which was considered culturally unacceptable for females. In 'Pearl Bryant,' for instance, the woman had an abortion before she was brutally killed. In case the threat of being murdered was not enough to deter southern women from breaking cultural norms, the songs stressed that torture, ghastly wounds, or mutilation of the corpse could occur."

"In addition to those tunes, other southern ballads involve the killing of pregnant white women. In fact,some are only found in the South."

"The tunes and the oral histories that surround this femicide are particularly interesting because they reveal that the 'good girl' versus 'bad girl' duality was thoroughly woven into southern culture. Several song versions, for example, imparted the message that bad things happened to 'good girls' when they turned into 'badgirls.' As late as the early twentieth century oral sources pointed out that Lewis 'ruin[ed]' Wise's 'fairname'  by getting her pregnant. She had been a decent, moral woman, until she had pre-marital sex. In their eyes, when she engaged in sex before marriage, she automatically 'disgrace[d]' herself. In fact, this attitudeemergedinmostversionsofthetune. Severalsongsters,for example, sang that Lewis promised to marry Wise so that there would be "no
disgrace.' One balladeer even pointed out that Lewis had 'shame[d] and disgrace[d]' Wise. In fact, when the singer claimed that Wise begged for her life and said, don't kill me, 'Let me live, full of shame,' he made it clear that he thought that Wise had been immoral. In addition, moral lessons emerged in many versions of the tune. One songster even cautioned young women that they must not be fooled into having pre-marital sex, or 'you are sure to meet Naomi's fate.' Another songster warned 'young ladies' not to be 'ruined' by such men."

"In the eyes of rural southern society, an unmarried woman's virginity was all important. Such songs also reflect that women, especially white women, were held to a higher sexual standard than men. Unlike a man, whose 'infidelity' was viewed by area residents as 'a natural sort of thing,' an unmarried white woman who lost her virginity was 'ruined.' Both Wise and Hattie Elliott had been 'good girls' before they met Lewis, but unlike Wise, the 'pure' Elliott 'baffled' Lewis when he tried to seduce her. In the end, however, Lewis chose to marry the virgin and kill the 'ruined' Wise. The moral message was clear; females, especially young white women, had to be 'good' or they had to be prepared to face the lethal consequences."

"Finally, femicide tunes are also culturally significant because they reveal how white southern society expected white women to behave. Infact, there were major gender differences in how white men and white women lyrically met their deaths. While white men often brawled with their would-be killers, and were romanticized for doing so, white women rarely were shown physically fighting their murderers before they were killed. Instead of glorifying white women who fought their attackers, these songs did the opposite--they reinforced the belief that a white woman should not be aggressive under any circumstances."

"These tunes also show that southern women were in a helpless position. Because the culture expected males to be aggressive and domineering, as the music indicates, women often felt helpless. Studies that deal with the abuse of women in male dominated societies show that when women are abused by males and do not fight back, they are expressing what society expects of them. These women feel helpless to protect themselves when 'confronted with a man who had been taught that the hands and feet may sometimes be used as weapons, and that dominance and aggression are justified expressions of his emotion or intent.' When southern music showed white women not responding aggressively to male violence, it reflected cultural realities. According to numerous studies, southern males were accustomed to fighting."

"As these examples demonstrate,the South was a male dominated society where brute force prevailed, and music reflected that most females simply had no other satisfactory alternative but to take to the abuse."

"In fact, if a woman killed her tormentor before he killed her, southern society over looked the male abuse and executed her. This is reflected in tunes such as 'Frankie Silver,' one of the few southern folk songs that depicted a white woman murde ringaman."


"In fact, in 1824 the Supreme Court of Mississippi became the first state court to recognize a husband'srighttobeathiswife. Mississippi wanted husbands to enforce 'domestic discipline.' Moreover, although in the late nineteenth century some southern states adopted anti-wife beating laws, no real enforcement policies existed. These laws were on the books, but criminal sanctions were rarely assessed."

"In 'TheDumbWife'..."

"In 1931 this blues star released the hit "Southern Can Is Mine," and in 1933 he followed suit with 'SouthernCanMama.'"

"These melodies also indicate that the rural South was a region where both African American and white women, especially wives, had limited power."

"In fact, blues men often attributed their brutal deeds to outside forces. In his 1928 hit 'Nobody's Dirty Business,' Mississippi John Hurt warned his female lover that one 'of these mornings' he was going to wake up drunk, grab his gun, and kill her. Resembling many other folk and blues tunes, in this popular number alcohol conveniently became the scapegoat for a vicious man. This is an indication that, similar to today, in the pre-World War II era alcohol was a frequent excuse, used by both males and southern society in general, to justify the battering of women. As long as society continued to blame domestic violence on either liquor or on the female victims themselves, the abuse would not end.

This indicates that the culture trivialized the abuse. In such cases,the domestic abuse was almost completely forgotten and glossed over. In fact, in the eyes of the singers, who reflected society's views, the female victims generally deserved whatever punishment they received.

Although music exposes that southern society expected males to enforce domestic discipline in their own households, in order to clearly understand how southern culture viewed women, some non-physical abuse tunes mustalsobeexamined. When analyzing southern songs it becomes apparent
that some men did not respect women.

Significantly, in both African American and white music, women were also seen as in animate objects. This could take on many different forms. A woman's looks were seen as essential to her worth. There are many such songs, but a few will suffice.

Other such songs also showed that unattractive women were left to their own protection, while young and beautiful women would be protected by males. Finally, many white songs discussed the 'lily white' hands, the delicate appearance and the child-like behavior of white women. This is not only blatant gender stereotyping, it also reinforced a common view that independent women were unattractive and manly.

Instead of starting out trading a horse, this southern man trades ahuman being. The man first 'buys' a wife. He than attempts to carry her home in a wheel barrow, but it broke, so, he 'sold' his wife and 'bought' a cow.

Moreover, in the most fundamental social structure of southern society, the family, folksongs demonstrate that it was culturally unacceptable for women to make decisions.

The blues also illustrated that black singers considered wives and female lovers the property of men. 

In the lyrics of these males, women were necessary for sex and procreation purposes, but that was about all. In fact, lyrically, females were often seen as disposable items that could be used and abused a male will tell a female that their children are solely her responsibility, and he will not allow her to work outside the home. Moreover, if a woman tries to leave her male lover, he will warn her that she will never see the children again. Similarly, these women are told that their children's friends or teachers will scorn them because of her actions.

If a female did not follow cultural norms, she was told that her children would suffer. In addition,society threatened to take children away from bad mothers. These threats were powerful. In fact, in the nineteenth century society used such warnings to stop divorce."

"In 'TheDumbWife,' for example, a doctor told a man that in order to 'make a scolding wife hold her tongue,' he should beat her with a hickory stick."

"Both the North and the South published hundreds of tunes during the Civil War, but there were major differences in how southern and northern singers and composers communicated the messages. Southern ditties, for example, were less humorous and more "ferocious and savage" than those of the North. Similarly, before and after the Civil War rural southern whites enjoyed singing savage English and Scottish murder ballads. In fact, homicide was one of the most popular song themes. "

Music helped southerners understand, accept, and explain their violent world.

"The prevalence of fighting and murdering tunes also reflects that in the late nineteenth century the rural South was rocked by "widespread and multifaceted crisis." In times of economic and social stress, southern mountaineers drank too much whiskey, behaved aggressively, and fought freely. This behavior eased their anxieties and emotions. It really did not matter that people died in the process, because that was how these males traditional reacted to their problems. Moreover, as the tunes indicated, a crime wave swept the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and southern homicides and prison populations both increased. In some areas of the rural South, the rowdiness actually grew worse in the years between the worldwars. In a small area on the Tennessee and Kentucky line, for example, approximately thirty people died violently between 1890-1919, thirty-three others followed suit from 1915-1940"

"In fact, rural hooligans customarily disrupted religious services by loitering outside church building, shooting their guns, drinking moonshine, talking loud, and cursing at all who passed by.

Since antebellum and postbellum folksongs were similar in how they portrayed social relations and human life, they reinforce studies that indicate the South has traditionally been a violent region. 

hot-tempers, trusted no one, instantaneously turned ruthless at the
slightest unfavorable remark, relied on brute force, and fought savagely. Instead of resembling the gallant gentleman of popular imagination, for example, music showed that southern brawlers would do anything in order to win. They stabbed people in the back, they clubbed defenseless individuals, they ambushed their human prey, and they used whatever weapon was available. Instead of formal duels, songs indicated that mountaineers were more apt to shoot someone from behind a tree or grab a stick of stove wood and bash in their unsuspecting victim's skull."

"African American tunes also reflected cultural ideas. Williamson, and a host of other singers did not have to give a motive, because blacks also thought people were simply cruel. In this regard, music shows southern African Americans and whites had a lot in common. Moreover, these tunes mirrored reality. Although African American rousters, for example, were not to carry weapons on river boats, most did. There were so many stabbings and slashings on some boats that everyone would have to line up and throw their knives into the water. In fact, immediately before World War II when black singers sang about using knives, razors, or guns, they discussed real events. Performer Dickie Wells claimed that both black and white musicians carried weapons. Wells always toted a pistol in the South, because his band 'ran up against a lot of frightful people' who wanted to 'beat up the band or shoot somebody.' When Well spulled his revolver, however, 'the cat' generally 'cool[ed] down.'

Many had abandoned the rural South because of the agricultural depression, only to find similar, or worse, conditions in the urban North. These songs demonstrated that African American males felt their manhood had been challenged. By bragging about killing or beating everyone that ever treated them wrong, these men were fighting back the only way they knew how. As their music indicated they equated manliness with brute force.

Music also mirrors that southern whites terrorized blacks more than African Americans killed whites. Again, these lyrics reflect reality. Although blacks could be violent, they generally directed their brutality towards other African Americans. Both the blues and African American folk music demonstrates this situation prevailed before WorldWarII. 

Such tunes also depicted that intense negative undercurrents existed between the two races.

southern music shows that deep-down African Americans knew the truth and bitterly resented the treatment they received"

The prevalence of violent tunes also reflects that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brutality ruled on southern dance floors. Similar, they mirror the fact that musicians of both races had a rugged life in the South. White southern musicians of tenper formed in rough environments. When the seper formers sang about killing and fighting, they revealed their everyday existences. Fights routinely brokeout at white dances throughout the mountain region. Music illustrates that many square dances were not the stereotypical prim and proper events of popular imagination. In the Ozarks, for example, backwoods frolics were still wild occurrences in the 1920s. People drank too much whiskey, most of the young males carried weapons, and bloody fights commonly occurred. In fact, rival families or neighborhoods met and settled quarrels at Ozark dances. If a gang of Arkansas males felt that they were not 'treated with proper consideration,' dwellings would be destroyed, lamps broken, and roofs 'riddled withbullets.' The settlers of Newton County, Arkansas, enjoyed square dances, but when the liquor flowed freely a "free-for-all fight and the use ofalong,keen-edgedknife,orpistol,wasnothinguncommon." When such fights occurred, chaos ruled, and feuds developed. At these events the proprietors customarily built a special shack in which they stored the violentmales. The men were held there until they cooled off.

"At Memphis taverns dead bodies were simply dumped outside so undertakers could collect them on their nightly runs. The Deep South was no better for black musicians."

"Before World War II every location below the Mason Dixon line may not have experienced extreme violence, but music indicates that at least some key areas did

Although songs cannot prove that the whole South was violent, they indicate that several culturally significant, and extremely large, areas were indeed brutal. Lyrics reflect that scholars were correct when they claimed violence was 'an essential fact of human life' in the South. In fact, the whole musical scene demonstrated that both black and white southerners had a predisposition to lethal violence.

Moreover, violence continued to erupt in times of social stress.

Finally, in the modern era the lack of murder tunes illustrated that rural southern culture and society had changed.

Although various motives behind lyrical violence existed, a significant theme reemerged in the music of the modern South: some southerners still thought that brute force,instead of debate, solved problems.

With sadistic events occurring throughout the region, some tunes, like the people themselves, began to display a very militant, often violent, attitude. In fact, at times southern music became as repulsive as it had been during Reconstruction. Prominent music historian Bill Malone calls this the 'ugliest chapter in country music's history.'"

"It is an indication that many southerners not oly resented the prosperity of the rest of nation, but they also understood the South's weakpoints. Like the people themselves, southern singers put on a 'big front,' but music illustrates that they knew that most southern states habitually ranked last in every positive classification, or first in every negative category. This type of music demonstrates that for several generations many southerners have had a 'chip on their shoulder,' when it came to 'yankees' and northern prosperity.

In the late twentieth century musicians not only lyrically associated the ideas of fighting and southern manliness, but in their public images and actions they also linked the two concepts. 

Furthermore, when all these southern 'good ol' boys' continually sang about adult lives filled with hard work, heavy drinking, and brawling, they mirrored significant cultural traits. This type of music reflects that when many young southern males walked off the factory line or skipped 'study hall' on Friday afternoon, they looked forward to 'picking up' women, filling their tanks with gas, drinking whiskey, and having a fight or two, so they could brag about all of it to their buddies. In songs like 'Wildlife Sanctuary' Bandy and Stampley were proud of this kind of lifestyle. In this song the duo boasted that a 'wildlife sanctuary' should be established for the dying breed of 'good ol' boys' who liked to brawl, throw liquor bottles at the band, and drink until the last drop of alcohol was gone unlike the rest of the United States, a majority of southerners are intolerant of homosexuality. In fact, according to many oral sources, gays are routinely harassed in the modern South. In one major study three- fourths of the participants reported harassment. As this tune indicated, this group was still persecuted openly in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s 'Philip,' a gay male from South Carolina, reported that southerners habitually called him 'faggot' and 'queer.'"

"Another type of factual tunes, feud songs, demonstrates that southern males used guns to uphold family honor.

All of the evidence also shows that southerners have traditionally viewed guns as more than simple hunting tools. In the music of the South firearms are generally used to kill humans, not animals. Instead of only being used for sport, in southern society guns have historically been viewed as protection devices for two of the most important elements in southern culture, family and honor. Feud songs were not the only songs that demonstrated this. 

Although firearms played a significant role in many of the cowboy tunes popular in the South, in these songs women did not customarily posses theguns. 

Theyrevealthat firearms have deep psychological and cultural roots in the South.

By listening to sadistic songs many white southerners proved they did not consider brutality towards blacks morally wrong. Such music indicates that some white southerners felt beating or burning a black person was really no different than punishing a disobedient animal. Instead of being something to abhor, the screams of a member of this race being tortured was something to be danced to and enjoyed." 

"Hundreds of farmers produced illegal whiskey before the Civil War, and back country southerners claimed, 'Where there's smoke, there's bound to
a be whiskey.'

After the Civil War liquor continued to be an important cultural element.

"Although the abundance of liquor tunes reflect that Appalachian inhabitants produced a considerable amount of moonshine, songs also clearly indicate that southerners in other locations participated in the occupation. Northern Arkansas was notorious for ambushing moonshiners and its good, albeit, illegal whiskey. There, many people accepted the trade and sang moonshine tunes. Ozark melodies, for instance, criticized Benjamin Franklin Taylor, a late nineteenth century revenue. Musical numbers also illustrate that non-mountainous regions made whiskey." 

"Besides reflecting that southern males continually bragged about their liquor consumption, such tunes illustrate deep-seated cultural assumptions. When southern singers boasted about their own, or other southern males, drinking habits, they revealed that for generations the macho male complex has been deeply ingrained in southern culture. This was never only a white or a black trait, because music indicates it influenced both races."

"Committing suicide with drugs also emerged in blues tunes, including Sam Collins' 1927 hit 'The Jail House Blues' and Rosa May Moore's 1928 single 'Stranger Blues,' but these were not the only blues numbers that alluded to drugs. As in folk tunes, however, dope tunes never approached the popularity of blues liquor tunes. The use of morphine, needles, cocaine, reefers, and dope are discussed, but references to whiskey alone outnumbered drug terms in blues songs popular enough to be reissued in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. As in earlier black folktunes cocaine was the most prevalent drug alluded to, but this drug made an appearance in fewer than ten songs"

"Also a large majority of addicts were middle and upper class southerners, but folk music was generally the music of the rural poor. In addition, many addicts were Civil War veterans who had been prescribed opiates in the war. This group hid their addictions, because when exposed they lost their pensions. These men would not have jeopardized themselves lyrically"

"Truck driving was one occupation especially affected by this drug. The pill popping habits of truck drivers were as much a part of their macho mystic as diesel fumes and eighteen wheelers. In reality these hard working individuals had to take speed in order to drive longer hours, stop less for food, and keep awake. The more miles they traveled, the more money they made. Southern truckers 'fulled on amphetamine goodwill' were common throughout the region, and they were audiences members in many backwater southern bars." 

Johnny Cash was also addicted to this drug. It was not gangsters, however, but Grand 01e Opry employees who got Cash hooked on the pills that almost destroyed his career."

"It was culturally acceptable for Cash to sing about truckers swallowing speed, because, unlike smoking reefer, the deeds reflected common situations, appeared macho, and were legal
Not only would the police harass musicians, but they might not have a job"

"Since the Civil War militant pro-South symbols have continuously emerged in southern music. During the Civil War, for instance, many melodies glorified the Confederate flag. After the war, flag and militant tunes remained in the oral tradition throughout the rural South. Although the patriotic zeal that accompanied America's entrance into World War II temporarily silenced southerners from glorifying the Confederacy, immediately after the war when the federal government began challenging the South's racial status quo. Confederate symbols reemerged. In fact, in the modern era Confederate symbolism routinely appeared in white tunes, concerts, and on album-cover art. Confederate memorabilia not only engulfed the whole southern rock and roll scene of the 1970s, but several southern performers also continued to utilize such items in the 1990s."

"Civil War and Reconstruction songs about the flag are significant, because they indicate that southerners viewed the stars and bars as more than a piece of cloth: it symbolized their nation. The popularity of these tunes also indicates that although southerners lost the Civil War, from the beginning of Reconstruction many were not going to obey northern dictates. As early as 1866 the tune, 'I'm A Good Old Rebel,' made this clear."

Although red-neck southern rockers stressed Confederate imagery the most, some country musicians also utilized the theme. In 1960, for example, a Hank Williams, Jr. publicity photograph showed the singer standing by his gun and sword collection, and its backdrop was a large Confederate flag."

Confederate Railroad, songs of Dixiee

"When Confederate symbolism continued to sell albums and promote southerness into the 1990s, it indicated that white southerners were still emotionally attached to the Civil War. In many ways they could not forget the past, nor could they completely cast off the idea that they were a unique group of people. Instead of being ashamed of their forefathers' actions, music illustrates that contemporary southerners continued to think and act like their Reconstruction ancestors."

## [Country Music](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/country-music-pbs-ken-burns-rosanne-cash-marty-stuart-1202173799/) ##
"The actual musicians who came onto the project were also able to help bridge the gap between these facts and the lore. Country music is rife with storytelling, and it’s just natural that some stories become more important that the actual way that events happen. Songwriter Harland Howard had once said, 'Country music is three chords and the truth. In the series, Texan singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell said, 'Country music at its best is truth-telling even when it’s a big fat lie.'"

Embracing country music means to embrace the storytelling, and thus it honors the colorful yarns spun and larger-than-life figures.

I listened to Sam [Phillips] tell how he discovered Elvis. The truth was better than anything Sam ever told, but that nobody was going to go, ‘Sam, that’s not how it happened.'” said Stuart. 'One thing that I love about country music, probably more so than any other culture – maybe the blues rivals it – there are so many American folk heroes. There’s the Coal Miner’s Daughter, the Man in Black, the Red-Headed Stranger, and on and on. They didn’t become folk heroes by pure myth; the thing I love is all of those people were voted in by the people.

The origins of country music can’t ignore the black influence, and the first episode is even titled 'The Rub,' referring to the friction or rubbing between black and white America. For example, the banjo is seen as a classic country music instrument, and it was descended from the African lute that was made from gourds. 'Country music comes from the south because that’s where slavery happened,' the series says.

In the series, only a handful of black country music performers are highlighted, and the common denominator in these stories is how race became an issue in their success and how they were perceived. Of course, standouts like Charley Pride and Carolina Chocolate Drops frontwoman Rhannon Giddens have been embraced in the field, but it still feels as if inclusion is still the exception. Although the series doesn’t venture far past 1996, one wonders how it would’ve handled the importance of someone like Lil Nas X – an out and proud gay black rapper who topped the country charts with his remix of his song “Old Town Road” with Billy Ray Cyrus.

Cash acknowledges how the personal accounts can color the story, but emphasizes that some facts just cannot be ignored, even by those who’d wish otherwise.

My own experience can’t help but color what I put out there. They were very generous and had respect about wanting to see through that prism, but everybody had it through their own prism,' she said. 'Facts are facts obviously – although today we are told they’re not – but they are. Seeing those facts through how they influenced different musicians and also the cohesion of how they told the story – bringing together Appalachian music and Bob Wills and Bakersfield and the African banjo and early folk music – all were put into the piece.'

Early setbacks for black artists are given a passing mention, before the series moves on. African-American musician DeFord Bailey was the first musician to be introduced on the Grand Ole Opry radio program and its first black performer when it became a stage show. When he went on tour, many of his fellow white performers had to stick by him when he was refused service because of his race. But in 1941, during the height of the licensing wars, he refused to learn non-ASCAP songs and was promptly fired. Judge George Hay, who had first hired Bailey, wrote off his longtime colleague, saying, 'Like many of his race, he was lazy.'

Although 'Country Music' doesn’t delve much deeper to examine the everyday racism in the music and its greatest stars, the truth lies in the present day. The mingling of cultures brought about this new genre, and yet, it’s evolved to forget and exclude African Americans. Or perhaps black America has decided to leave country music behind."

## [Scandalous Saddle](https://truewestmagazine.com/the-scandalous-saddle/) ##
"Women riding aside leads to dangerous (and ridiculous) saddle invention.

Buffalo Bill’s Wild West sharpshooter Annie Oakley rode aside, as in this picture, performing '…horseback tricks from a sidesaddle, a contraption with a flat seat, on which the rider sat sideways, and a thick, leather-covered hook, which the rider used to anchor herself by her leg to the horse’s back,' wrote Glenda Riley, in The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley. She also took advantage of the sidesaddle, Riley added. When Oakley dangled off the side of her horse to pick up a hat off the ground, she appeared as if “she floated on the horse’s back.

As absurd as this may sound, the sidesaddle took hold in the 14th century to protect the virginity of a teenaged princess traveling across Europe to wed the young King of England.

Surprised? Don’t feel alone. Most assume the sidesaddle was the natural outcome of fashion, demanded by the long, flowing, sometimes over-hooped skirts favored for so many centuries.

For some 500 years, women were told the only way a 'proper lady' sat on a horse was sideways, holding on for dear life, a passenger on a 1,500-pound animal she could barely control."


"Princess Anne of Bohemia, a predecessor of the modern Czech Republic, was the daughter of the most powerful monarch in Europe in 1382 when she left for England to wed King Richard II. To ensure her virgin marriage, ruling men instructed her to ride aside, rather than astride."


"Women hadn’t always ridden so askew.

Although ancient Greek sculptures depict women riding aside, it was an option, not a demand. Joan of Arc didn’t ride into battle in the 1400s as a dainty maid. Geoffrey Chaucer depicted his 'Wife of Bath' riding astride in the 1300s. Central Asian women mounted horses like their brothers did, and Amazon women were famous for both their trousers and riding astride.

But then came Anne and the fixation on 'virtuous virgins.' Folks like to mimic royals, so the idea of a sidesaddle spread.

By 1600, riding aside was the only way a “decent” woman could ride a horse without scorn. Most women went willingly along—except for Catherine the Great, of course, who was so powerful, she decreed her court would all ride astride.

'The reins, both of personal power and individual equestrian control, had been taken away by men who now restricted a woman’s political and equestrian destinies,' CuChullaine O’Reilly wrote for the Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation."


"Sidesaddle Designs

The earliest sidesaddle design was little more than a pillow and a piece of wood that faced the woman off to the scenery on the left side of the horse. This replaced the pillion—a small padded seat where the woman rode behind a male rider. The newer saddle allowed the lady to ride alone, but still gave her no control over the animal—she sat so precariously, it’s a wonder all rides didn’t end in injury. Another rider held the reins and led her horse along; she could do little but cling to the pommel and hope she didn’t fall off. The woman was not exactly “riding” the horse; she was just sitting on it as it moved.

In the 16th century, Catherine de’ Medici is credited with inspiring a saddle that allowed the woman to face forward. In this saddle, she hooked her right leg around a pommel on the saddle and placed her left foot in a stirrup. This gave her a fighting chance to stay in the saddle and handle the reins herself. But even this saddle only allowed her to proceed slowly—any speed was dangerous.

Even some female writers agreed. As the 20th century dawned and balked, British author Alice Hayes saw the first rumblings against a sidesaddle, denouncing these 'feminine desperadoes.' Although she vehemently argued women should ride sidesaddle, she did admit that the sidesaddle’s impractical design placed women in harm’s way."

"1893 book, The Horsewoman: A Practical Guide to Side-Saddle Riding"


"By 1900, American women were split on the issue—along geographic lines. Women in the East clung to the sidesaddle as proper and necessary, while Western women saw them as impractical and dangerous. Western women were far more likely to use a horse for farm and ranch labor than their Eastern sisters, who saw the horse as a weekend entertainment.

'Not one of us would tolerate the old-fashioned sidesaddle,' said one of the record 25 women inducted into the Vaquero Riding Club, composed of expert horsemen of Spanish heritage, during the early 1900s."


“'Two-Gun' Nan Aspinwall began calling herself 'Montana Girl' in 1906, two years before she started performing with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Pawnee Bill’s Great Far East troupe, where she became a hit."

“Snappy Western Girl Who Rode Horse Clear Across Continent”

Death Valley Days
Sisters in the Saddle

"In 1912, Alberta Claire made her 8,000-mile solo trip from Wyoming to Oregon, down through California, across the Arizona desert and into New York City. Along the way, she declared to anyone who’d listen that she had both the right to ride astride and the right to vote.

History does not record whether or not Claire ever met New York’s Inez Milholland, though they were contemporaries. Nevertheless, these two women were sisters in the saddle.

Nobody tied politics and riding astride as did Milholland, the beautiful face of the suffrage movement.

Milholland was born into a liberal family of means in Brooklyn in 1886. She became a lawyer—turned down by Yale and Harvard because of her sex—and gave lectures throughout the nation to support women’s rights. She led suffrage marches in 1911, 1912 and 1913, while astride a white horse named Gray Dawn."


"Getting up on a high horse takes on a new meaning when you think about the public performances of women ascending hot air balloons while seated sidesaddle on her horse, as shown in this circa 1880 lithograph. The first horse sent aloft in the air flew by platform, a dream realized by fox hunter Tetu-Brissy in 1797, and the horse graduated to a balloon in 1830, thanks to English aeronaut Charles Green. — Courtesy Library of Congress"


"Western women were also making their mark as North America’s first professional female athletes—in rodeos. Not one of them considered riding sidesaddle as they put their lives on the line to entertain while on horseback."


"Strangely enough, though, one of the greatest rodeo queens got her start riding sidesaddle. In her first rodeo event, at a county fair in 1906, 13-year-old Vera McGinnis was the only rider who rode sidesaddle, in a dress, competing against much older girls. 'It so happened that the horse show judge was a bit old fashioned and frowned upon such things as girls riding clothespin-style so Vera won first prize, a gold-handled umbrella,' True West reported in 1991."

“Sidesaddles and Suffragettes, the Fight to Ride and Vote.”

“'The fall of the sidesaddle is linked to the rise of female liberty, for it was the dawning of political freedom which brought about the overdue death of this repressive equine invention,' she wrote."

## [Revisiting China’s Southern Frontiers in the Ming–Qing Periods: Editors’ Introduction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00094633.2019.1635850) ##
"In 1911, the revolution led by Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) and his associates in the Revolutionary Alliance that overthrew the Manchu Qing dynasty was a landmark event in the history of Asia. It not only founded the first republic in Asia, but also ended the imperial rule of the country in the past two millennia. In other words, the 1911 Revolution marked the transition of empire to nation-state for China. While this change was consistent with worldwide historical developments, this was by no means an easy and smooth process for the Chinese. From the early 17th century, nation-state building began in Western Europe and gradually became a main trend of history around the world in the subsequent centuries. One of the major differences between empire and nation-state was shown in its policy toward outside regions. From ancient period, Chinese rulers entertained the notion of “All under Heaven” (tianxia 天下) in describing its imperial realm. Some scholars have considered such view as the “boundless world” (wubian tianxia 無邊天下). By contrast, a nation-state is built on a clearly defined border, or with the “limited boundary” (youxian jiangjie 有限疆界).1 From another perspective, an empire usually consisted of innerland and frontier, or center-periphery regions, whereas a nation-state hopes to control, indiscriminately, all regions within its territory. The changing meaning of the term Zhongguo 中國 underscored the transition of China from an empire to a nation-state in the early twentieth century. Over the long imperial period, Zhongguo usually referred to the core area under the reigning dynasty. As such, it was rendered as the “Middle Kingdom.” But in the process of nation-building, Zhongguo began to be used, by historians in particular, to describe China as a modern state.

But the imperial legacy remained, particularly with respect to modern China’s territorial control. The Republic of China of 1911 and the subsequent People’s Republic of China founded in 1949 both inherited the Qing empire’s territory, consisting such frontier regions as Manchuria in the northeast, (Inner) Mongolia in the northwest, and Tibet in the southwest. In this issue of Chinese Studies in History, we present the studies of frontier regions in South China, including today’s Tibetan Buddhist regions in Sichuan, mountainous areas in Yunnan, and southeast coastal regions in Fujian, during the late imperial periods. Our purpose is to showcase how the Ming and Qing dynasties envisioned their territories, designed their frontier policies, and implemented them for exercising control.

The field of frontier studies was dominated by a center-periphery discourse for a long time. That is, the idea of “All under Heaven” was a dominating concept for rulers in China, regardless their ethnicity, to entertain an all-encompassing notion of their world. Meanwhile, most rulers also had a full recognition that their imperial realm was composed of various zones, differentiated by levels of cultural development and characteristics of ethnicity. In early imperial China, for example, the policymakers had already developed the “five zone” concept in perceiving their territorial and demographic composition. For each zone, they designed different policies to best exercise control, ranging, as it were, from “free reign” to “acculturation” and “pacification.” In building modern China, needless to say, the Chinese government developed markedly different ruling policies toward frontier regions. But after founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, communist leaders also established several “autonomous districts” in outside regions like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Guangxi, which remain in place today. Thus, there has been a level of historical continuity with respect to frontier policies. At the same time, we also recognize that in more recent years, Chinese leaders have made significant changes to their ruling methods of these aforementioned regions. All this, we hope, attests to the importance of the study included in this issue.

This issue is edited also because though the outward expansion through military and economic vehicles from China’s political centers was, by any measure, the basic pattern that dynasties in Chinese history took shape, the historiography on such processes has experienced dramatic change over the past decades. The idea of overwhelming imperial extension that encompasses political annexation, cultural assimilation, and economic colonization has been constantly challenged. Instead, more attention is cast on the so-called frontier dwellers who were previously deemed voiceless and had no agency in the face of imperial imposition. Such a shift is at first made possible by the discovery of local materials in the so-called frontier regions, and second, is a reflection of new scholarly interest that calls for revisiting the nature of empires with marginalized experiences. The four articles in this special issue together present how this new trend is played out in Chinese academia."


"At the risk of oversimplification, we may perhaps argue that there have occurred two “turns” in the historiography of Chinese frontier history that affected the study as a whole in recent years: the “empire turn” and the “local turn.” The “empire turn” reconsiders “frontier” not as clearly demarcated border that separates nation-states, but the utmost reach of imperial expansion. In other words, “frontier” is not a linear boundary that defines the realm of state control, but rather an open sphere of encounter, contestation, and test point of the limit of imperial power. In this way, studies on the frontiers following the “empire turn” are usually situated in the macro frameworks of transnational geopolitics or structural comparison between multiple polities. By contrast, the “local turn” usually examines frontier history at the micro level. By paying attention to specific locales or communities, scholars tend to highlight on-the-ground agency and grassroots improvization. As such, the local turn enables scholars to reconsider the center-periphery dichotomy. Indigenous voices from the frontier may reveal how the so-called peripheries conceived themselves and their domains as the center lying amid multiple outsiders from afar. Therefore, the history of frontiers should be investigated on their own terms. The notion of “center-periphery,” as a conceptual tool, tends to marginalize the frontier region’s role in state formation. While the interaction between the metropole and the frontier is not always precipitated by the former, it is often the frontier that triggers changes and bends the state apparatus to its own will."


"The rise and development of two schools reflect and influenced the aforementioned two turns in Chinese frontier history: the New Qing History school (新清史) and the Southern China school (華南學派). One must note that these are not self-appellations, but rather names given by others. Although dissents existed within both schools, scholars tend to agree on certain key points or address common questions in similar ways. The New Qing History scholars question the hegemony of Chinese materials and classic Chinese historiography. On the contrary, they rely on non-Chinese sources to reconsider the structure of Qing imperial repertoire and revisit “China” as an analytical category. Highlighting the diversity and variety within the empire, the New Qing History scholars take frontier regions as the manifestation of the Qing empire’s heterogenous imperial nature. But is the Qing unique in this regard? As indicated in Lian Ruizhi and Zhao Shiyu’s articles, the Ming empire was quite flexible as well in creating an administrative structure that allows semiautonomous secular regimes and religious communities for indigenous practices. In that case, do we see any fundamental difference between the Ming and Qing empires’ multiethnic and hierarchical imperial order? Another contribution made by the authors of this special issue is to challenge the hegemony of ethnicity. As one significant keyword in early-stage New Qing History scholarship, ethnic identification was given extensive attention to check the domination of the Sinicization discourse. However, as Chen Boyi and Hu Xiaobai point out, ethnicity was not always the parameter of the Qing empire’s frontier policy. Chen claims that approaches to restructure grassroots communities in China proper may not differ much from those in non-Han regions; religion, as indicated in Hu’s work, oftentimes transcended ethnic and linguistic boundaries and functioned as a significant variable that formed and reformed frontier landscape. The four articles on Ming–Qing China’s southern frontier demonstrate great potential to dialog with the New Qing History scholarship that so far has shed more light on the empire’s Inner Asian frontiers."

## [Thomas Jefferson](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founders/thomas-jefferson) ##
"Thomas Jefferson hoped that he would be remembered for three accomplishments: his founding of the University of Virginia, his crafting of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and his authorship of the Declaration of Independence. It is for the last that he has most endeared himself to succeeding generations as a champion of liberty and equality.

Jefferson believed that these achievements were the high points of a life dedicated to the promotion of human freedom. Education, he held, freed the mind from ignorance, tolerance freed the will from coercion, and the assertion of human liberty and equality freed the body from the chains of tyranny. Securing religious liberty in the new republic was one of Thomas Jefferson’s most important goals. His papers, including the letter to the Danbury Baptists Association, as well as the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, reveal a statesman who recognized the civic utility of religion, but believed that government had no business regulating belief.

However, Jefferson’s actions sometimes contradicted his words. An opponent of centralized power, as president he completed the Louisiana Purchase and unhesitatingly employed the resources of the federal government to enforce the harsh and unpopular Embargo Act. Although a proponent of individual rights, he excused the atrocities committed by the French Revolutionaries during the Reign of Terror. A critic of slavery who outlawed the slave trade as president, he was the owner of more than 200 African American slaves. Understanding Jefferson lies in the difficult task of reconciling these inconsistencies."
