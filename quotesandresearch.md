# Political Rebellion #
"Societies exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in a slight degree, and in our states in a great one. 3. Under governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the 1st. condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has it’s evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.1 Unsuccesful rebellions indeed generally establish the incroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them. An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage them too much. It is a medecine necessary for the sound health of government." - Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, Paris, January 30, 17872

## [Bound Up in One Great Bundle of Humanity](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1866-frances-ellen-watkins-harper-we-are-all-bound-together/) ##
"'We are all bound up in one great bundle of humanity, and society can’t trample on the weakest and feeblest among its members without receiving the curse in its own soul,' she declared." -Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, 1866

"We have a woman in our country who has received the name of 'Moses,' not by lying about it, but by acting it out-a woman who has gone down into the Egypt of slavery and brought out hundreds of our people into liberty. The last time I saw that woman, her hands were swollen. That woman who had led one of Montgomery’s most successful expeditions, who was brave enough and secretive enough to act as a scout for the American army, had her hands all swollen from a conflict with a brutal conductor, who undertook to  eject her from her place. That woman, whose courage and bravery won a recognition from our army and from every black man in the land, is excluded from every thoroughfare of travel. Talk of giving women the ballot-box? Go on. It is a normal school, and the white women of this country need it. While there exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and selfishness, it is the white women of America." -Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, 1866

"In his 1963 'Letter from Birmingham Jail,' Martin Luther King echoed Harper's commitment to promoting a common community of interests when he wrote, 'I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states . . . . Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.' These words recall Harper's statement to the women at the 1866 Eleventh National Women's Rights Convention: 'We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity, and society cannot trample on the weakest and feeblest of its members without receiving the curse in its own soul.' Harper argued for cooperative effort among women to protect civil rights and alleviate corruption. King argued for cooperative effort among the Alabama clergymen, concerned about his disruptive presence in the city, to work against racial injustice and protect civil rights."

## [Frances Harper Bends the Arc](https://www.uua.org/re/tapestry/youth/call/workshop2/arc) ##
"Sometimes, freedom is a long time coming.

It may take generations upon generations for justice to be won. Our Unitarian ancestor Reverend Theodore Parker said, 'I do not pretend to understand the moral universe: the arc is a long one... from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.'

The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr, often used this quote. Barack Obama, 44th and first African American president of the United States added,'... but here is the thing: it does not bend on its own. It bends because each of us in our own ways put our hand on that arc and we bend it in the direction of justice....'

The hands of Unitarian Universalist have been bending the arc for many years. You may have heard of John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Christopher Reeve, or Rachel Carson. Have you heard of Frances Ellen Watkins Harper? Her hand was on the arc, too.

Harper was born a free black woman in Baltimore, Maryland in 1825. She was raised in the household of her uncle, an educator and African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister. He was also an abolitionist—a person who objected to the enslavement of blacks. Harper followed in her uncle's footsteps to become an educator and abolitionist. She also became a writer, publishing her first book of poetry at twenty and publishing the first short story by an African American woman later in life. Her writing often urged blacks, women, and people in oppressed groups to take a firm stand for equality.

In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed. It became dangerous to be a free black in Maryland because slave owners could claim black people were runaway slaves and force them into slavery. So, Harper moved farther north to Ohio and then to Philadelphia. She taught, ran part of the Underground Railroad, and lectured around the country to bend the arc toward justice for African Americans. In 1863, abolitionists celebrated success with the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. It did not immediately create a world where African Americans were treated equally and fairly, but it did make slavery illegal.

Harper saw that there was still work to be done. She put her hand toward women's civil rights, in particular the rights of black women and the right of all women to vote. She co-founded the National Association of Colored Women. Again, she toured and lectured on the topic of freedom. Her lectures and writings spoke to the need for women to be free to be more than wives and mothers. She understood what she was talking about: a mother herself, after her husband died Frances Harper took her daughter with her on her lecture tours.

During her justice work, Harper met many Unitarians also working to bend the arc. She felt at home with our liberal religious beliefs and knew that her work could strengthen the justice work of the Unitarians. She joined hands with them by joining the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia in 1870. She frequently read her poetry from the pulpit at this church, yet she kept her membership and taught Sunday school at an AME church, too.

Harper died in 1911, before the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1919. This was a cause she worked hard to bring about. Yet, Harper understood that her labors might bring about freedoms she would never enjoy. She said, 'Apparent failure may hold in its rough shell the germs of a success that will blossom in time, and bear fruit throughout eternity.' Some of the fruits of Harper's labor—and the labor of other Unitarian Universalists—are enjoyed by us today. Yet, we are not done. Oppression still exists in our world. Harper's hands—and Parker's, Adam's, Anthony's, Reeve's and Carson's—are no longer on the arc. Our hands are needed to take their place."

"Now the only way to avoid this shipwreck and to provide for our posterity is to follow the counsel of Micah; to do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with our God. We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain each other in brotherly affection...we must delight in each other; make others' condition our own, rejoice together; mourn together, labor, and suffer together...for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us; so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world...we shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us..."

"Sitting in the cab, Rachel looked out the window as Swati slept next to her and the car sat in Mumbai's never-ending traffic. Outside, the city raged and dozed and moved, always a kaleidoscope of action, as all big cities were, but as Mumbai especialy was, a writhing mass of humanity grinding and struggling against itself, as endless multiheaded snake, a hydra of a city eating itself and fighting itself day in and day out." (p. 235, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Sometimes, just as Rachel woke up, when the fan blew cooler air across her body and the world outside was somehow magically quiet, she almost thought she was in New York and not India. She forgot, for a spli second, that she was miles away, and smiled at the thought of a bagel, fresh, covered in sesame seeds and bursting with schmeer. But then something would remind her. **The call of banana sellers, the thousand honks of cars and rickshaws and buses and motorcycles, a faint trill of bicycle bells, or the loud chattering of the many murders of crows perched in the palm trees, sinister voices in tropical havens." (p. 71, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"People like her watched the city through windows as millions of people walked from place to place to work and buy food and find space outside the millions of tiny cramped apartments in the city." (p. 99, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Sitting in the cab, Rachel looked out the window as Swati slept next to her and the car sat in Mumbai's never-ending traffic.

"He came home buzzing, elated with the thrill of loving what he did. Loving helping other business run faster, better, more efficiently. Every day was a series of puzzles Dhruv got to solve, with pleasing money-saving solutions as the reward for his efforts. The puzzles had become harder and mroe complicated in India, and he reveled in it. It excited his brain. It made him happy." (p. 236, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"She looked out onto the sweep of the city, the view from the highway showing her the foothills of South Mumbai, the Sea Link bridge rising dramtically over the water, tiny fishing boats dwarfed by skyscrapers, all of it somehow in the same place at once. Just like her, somehow there, somehow sitting in a rickshaw next to a million other people, all on the same road in the same place; who knew how or why?" (p. 271, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"All you had to do was look out your window, or get out of your rickshaw a little before your destination, and there it all was, the swirling mass of humanity all at once, in every direction. But perhaps many people, the world over, didn't een do that, when it came to life around them. And those women didn't ride in rickshaws, anyway." (p. 274, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The next Saturday, as they dodged crowds of tourists taking photos of masterpieces with their phones, she watched his face as he looked at painting after painting with the same expression he had worn since she met him on the steps outside the building: nothing. Blankness. Her heart began to sink. The man who had seemed so interesting and alluring in the **warmth** and the **dark light** of the bar now looked lifeless, and she had just decided that she wouldn't be seeing him again when they stopped in front of Vermeer's *Young Woman with a Water Pitcher*." (p. 75, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"When she had first come to Mumbai, it had whirled past her window in the cab from the airport, and it had looked so much dingier than she had thought it would, as if the city were sepia toned, broken by bright flashes that seemed garish in comparison." (p. 78, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The dark was beginning to fall, although it was early, only six P.M. and Rachel realized with a start that it was autumn, actually, even though it didn't feel like it; that's why the light was fading. Th eweather never changed much, and she had forgotten that time was moving on regardless. She was getting older, every day. She had lived in Mumbai a day longer every morning. And Swati lived with them longer very minute. But the city was indifferent to Rachel's problems. It had enough of its own." (p. 235, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"They craved the taste of human flesh and ate villagers who strayed too far into their territory, those who stayed out fishing too late, who didn't heed the setting of the sun, who planted their rice too far beyond teh boundaries of their village land. The more they ate, the more they craved. Rumors passed through Kolkata on the backs of newspapers and servants with relatives in the little towns that dotted the mangrove forests, that the tigers had stopped hunting other prey altogether, that they only focused on humans now. People said you didn't know they were there until they snuck up on you, emerging out of the water, silent strong swimmers that they were, a pair of violent yellow eyes glowing in the night, lighting the way to your doom."

"Looking at the delicate painting, the rich tapestry in one corner, the open light streaming through the window and illuminating the young woman's face as she concentrated, a moment caught forever, as precise and clean as a photograph but so much deeper, so much more, he looked stunned. His mouth moved slightly, and his eyes widened, and suddenly, his whole face opened up for her, like a pair of shutters being flung back to let in the morning sun. 'I like this one,' he said, nodding, certain, authoritative. 'It's so simple, but the light. I love the light.'" (p. 75, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The sun was setting as the rickshaw ascended the highway ramp. Taking the fragile little vehicles on the highway should have terrified Rachel, but instead, it gave her a sense of exhilerated delight. She could be crushed at any moment. She could roll right out of the open sides of the rickshaw and slam her body into the highway. The interior became a wind tunnel, and she closed her eyes, inhaling the polluted air, which, nevertheless, refreshed her. Her hair whipped around her face and her eyes stung when she opened them again, but it didn't matter." (p. 271, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The new technology increased the amount of light indoors; at the same time, the problem of lighting more generally was one that was being addressed. Across Europe, as cities expanded, and buildings grew taller, as population density increased, and as streets therefore became darker and more filled with strangers, how to light the streets became a civic preoccupation. Some cities tried to rebuild their narrow medieval streets, either widening individual routes, or, more ambitioiusly, replacing the meandering medieval roads with streets laid out in a grid pattern, to allow more moonlight to penetrate. But improving artificial lighting was a simpler, and cheaper, solution." (p. 216, "The Making of Home: The 500-Year Story of How Our Houses Became Homes", Judith Flanders)

"And while Amsteradam's street lights were fixed to the houses, Parisian street lights hung from ropes that ran across the streets of Paris were lined with more than eight thousand lights. In 1680, Prussia, too, started to experiment with street lighting, adopting yet another system. Here the lamps were hung from poles erected for the purpose, a precursor to lamp posts. Of all northern Europe's major urban centres, London lagged furthest behind. Late into the eighteenth century, its civic authorities only required lamps to be affixed to houses, without regulating the type of light, nor attempting to enforce technological improvements, as Amsterdam had.

"Throughout the eighteenth century, most major cities, as well as smaller towns that had no official arrangements for lighting, continued to rely on link-bearers - men carrying torches of burning pitch - to cover areas where there was no street lighting, or where the dark was so profound that the lamps were inadequate. The sources of funding for street lighting predictably influenced public attitudes to link-bearers, even though these men were not paid by the city, or the government, but were in business independently. In Paris, where lighting was a police matter, the bearers were widely believed to be informers who sold information about night-movements to the police."

"The first technological advance on wax and tallow candles came at the end of the eighteenth century, when spermaceti, the fat from sperm whales, was found to burn more cleanly than tallow, and began to be commercially processed. By the mid-nineteenth century, stearine, extracted from tallow, but less smelly, was also available, as were palm- or coconut-oil candles."

"Even before the appearance of these new technologies, candles had always been a luxury. In most agricultural and even many urban districts, well into the nineteenth century, most tasks were performed by firelight, including many involving skills that today are thoguht to require a bright light, such as sewing or reading. Given both the relative scarcity of windows, and, in North America, the continued use of shuttered, unglazed windows, artificial light was frequently needed indoors during the day as well as at night. As fires were necessary for cooking, they were often the primary light source as well. Candles were used chiefly to provide light when moving from one room to another, ..."

The hours after dusk and before bedtime were reserved for leisure activities that needed some light: reading, conversation and music. The most festive occasions in this sophisticated household still used far less light than we might iamgine. One party for seven adutls and an unspecified number of children was described as having a 'splendid' appearance, owing to the seven candles that illuminated the room."

"He was the kind of man who **believed** hismelf to be better than other people. He liked to be so. He enjoyed knowing where he stood next to others. He had liked her own moral rigidity, her disinterest in breaking with the rituals and conventions of their lives, and yet he had wanted to surpass her in them." (p. 138, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Now, though, she woke up eager to be Magda. Magda lived a life lit with courage. She was forever willing to see the best in others, to be hopeful, to open her heart." (p. 184, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Rachel tried to speak slowly, which was not in her nature. Her in-laws had, when she met them, look confused when she spoke, which Dhruv told her was because she had an American accent, but she privately believed was because they couldn't speak English that well." (p. 12, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"She had seen that kind of happiness in television shows and movies, that American cheer, and she had thought that was just for Westerners. But if Dhruv could find it, if he could be so close with someone, so happy from that closeness, then surely it was not a Western trait at all." (p. 20, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"'You are American. That is what American stories are like. Maybe he made it like that.'" (p. 58, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"What did all this look like to her? Swati wondered. She had seen some movies set in America, and everything looked so orderly there. The shops where you bought food were air-condition and white and everything was all together." (p. 60, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Luckily Rachel's parents were American, and couldn't tell anyone in India, therefore didn't matter, but still." (p. 87, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"But Dhruv had refused to do so. Bunny's son, Arjun, though, had gone to America for school but then come back right away and used his newfound knowledge to expand the confection factory and business, even moving the company..." (p. 94, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"'Why should I adapt to her just because she is American? She is living here,' Swati said, with more force than she intended. But it was true, wasn't it, it was what she had been telling herself day after day, that Rachel had to adapt, she had no choice. But wasn't that part of why you left Vinod? For choices?" (p. 178, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"she had looked up how to pronounce each word in Hindi, they became garbled in ehr mouth and the man didn't know what she was saying, and grew confused, and she ended up angry, her face hot and her voice an octave higher than it normally was, hanging up the phone in frustration" (p. 1, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"She had joined an expat Facebook group before she moved to the city, and that had led to a few others, and now she was a member of multiple groups, which threw events and had chatty members who had lots of opinions about subjects Rachel had little interest in. People asked about where to find a summer camp for their six-year-old, or if it was better to vacation in Goa or Kerala, and at which beach and which hotel, and plugged their new business ideas and wellness sessions with earnest abandon. Rachel didn't think she would have much to say to the people discussing these new things, but facing the reality of making friends as an adult in a new city, she tried to go to the meet-ups and participate online." (p. 6, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"He didn't seem to know so many of the customs; perhaps they were the domain of women, or perhaps he hadn't been paying attention gorwing up. He had lived abroad for years, too; maybe things had changed." (p. 13, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Rachel had read many books by Indian authors before she had arrived in Mumbai, trying to fill the gaps in her knowledge and in Dhruv's descriptions with information. She had never been to India before she moved, and now she realized that perhaps that had been a good thing." (p. 13, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Listening intently, she heard murmuring in the living room, words she didn't understand, a conversation in Hindi. She heard more Hindi than English most days; it was a shame she still hadn't learned much. She wasn't good with languages, not like Dhruv was. Everything just passed her by; she could feel things washing over her, nothing sticking in her mind." (p. 42, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

# Infrastructure #
"The streets of Mumbai were bumpy with potholes, speed bumps to slow down fast-moving motorcycles and derail bicycle delivery boys. Every few seconds a bump or depression would rip through the car, jolting Rahcel and Swati against each other. Each woman clutched the side of the car as a matter of course. The seat belts never functioned in these cars, or the black-and-yellow taxis, let alone a rickshaw. As she had grown older, Swati had felt her body protesting Kolkata's ill-kept streets, but somehow Mumbai, wealthy, shiny Mumbai, was even worse. Looking out, though the breeze from the sea caught the trees and the sun felt strong, even though it was autumn. That was nothing like Kolkata's chilly gloom, and Swati found herself smiling out into the bright day, enjoying how the light hit the bright magenta bougainvillea growing like weeds from every balcony and over every fence."

# The Art of Ecology #
## [The Art of Ecology](https://intercongreen.com/2012/09/12/the-art-of-ecology/) ##
"Irons finds her inspiration for her work in the complexities of natural ecologies and their interconnected component, leaving it as no surprise that I was drawn to her work immediately. One of her fascinating collections grew from the notion of bird migration related to the loss of habitat from human development. These events can cause evolutions, or even the outright collapse, of ecosystems overtime that may ultimately find their way to regrowth. Ellie walked me through the first piece in the series that works with pencil and water on paper that is collaged with pieces of vintage bird guides. A network of branch-like forms gives birth to the color and shape of birds as it evolves across the three pages of the piece before fading out with only a hint of possible rejuvenation at the end. This series evolved into a “night” migration collection that I was particularly drawn to as well.

When she is not producing innovative artwork in her studio she also teaches art to both college students at City College and second graders as a resident artist at the Learning Through Art Program at the Guggenheim."

"Ellie showed me another piece that took a different angle in reflecting on the interface and overlap between the natural and the man-made. Done in a combination of ink and watercolor, the composition has a rhythm generated by the diamonds of chain link fence over a field of colored tones with reversed silhouettes of plant life behind–the delicate overlap of leaves and stems inherently striking the parallel between the more rigid lines of twisted metal. On the right her birds return with a fluid form that resembles a completed bird at one point but dissolves into fence at one end and towards the network of leaves at the other. To me, the piece clearly highlighted how inseparable the environments of civilization and nature are with each unavoidably affecting the other.  I encourage anyone and everyone to take a more thorough look at her website.

Given that Ellie is an artist with interested in ecology and urban restoration, I had to ask her opinion of the Highline (which I think is extraordinary)."

"When asked if there were artists that had served as inspiration for her when it came to her ecological focus or natural media, she had an ample list. She mentioned Newton & Helen Mayer Harrison who work closely with the fields of ecology and biology to promote biodiversity and community development. Also included were Mark Dion and Agnus Denes. One of Denes’ most well known projects was the installation of a wheat field in the New York Battery Park landfill in 1982–grain that would ultimately be harvested at travel to 28 cities in a work that the artist described as commenting on “human values and misplaced priorities.”

Ellie’s work takes on a difficult task: trying to depict the connections of systems that are almost too complicated to describe, but the depth of her composition conveys the amount of information that operates behind the scenes. Again, despite the fact that Ellie Iron’s artwork and the informational resource of Intercon have missions that are closely related, the delivery is meaningfully different–but that could be a good thing. The more ways we can try to convey what is important, the underlying force of sustainability and why it is essential, the better chances we have of conveying more knowledge to more people. If anyone else has artists whose work operates in a similar vein, please share them as well."
