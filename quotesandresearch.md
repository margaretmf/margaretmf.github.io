# Political Rebellion #
"Societies exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in a slight degree, and in our states in a great one. 3. Under governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the 1st. condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has it’s evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.1 Unsuccesful rebellions indeed generally establish the incroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them. An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage them too much. It is a medecine necessary for the sound health of government." - Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, Paris, January 30, 17872

"I can easily trace my goal of becoming mayor to my freshman year of college. Through my volunteer work, I'd already regularly attended city council emetings na understood the importance of a mayor's decisions in tackling the poverty in Atlanta. When I first added the goal to my spreadsheet, I held a superficial dream of being in charge of the city. But later in that spring of 1992, America exploded when the Rodney King verdict was announced in late April. In Los Angeles, the city teemed with a violence that had not been seen in decades. In downtown Atlanta, where I attended school, young black men and women smashed windows, overturned cars, and ransacked the city. For my part, I joined with fellow students in silent march down to city hall from the Atlanta University Center known to Atlantans at the AUC." (pp. 15-16, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

## [Bound Up in One Great Bundle of Humanity](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1866-frances-ellen-watkins-harper-we-are-all-bound-together/) ##
"'We are all bound up in one great bundle of humanity, and society can’t trample on the weakest and feeblest among its members without receiving the curse in its own soul,' she declared." -Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, 1866

"We have a woman in our country who has received the name of 'Moses,' not by lying about it, but by acting it out-a woman who has gone down into the Egypt of slavery and brought out hundreds of our people into liberty. The last time I saw that woman, her hands were swollen. That woman who had led one of Montgomery’s most successful expeditions, who was brave enough and secretive enough to act as a scout for the American army, had her hands all swollen from a conflict with a brutal conductor, who undertook to  eject her from her place. That woman, whose courage and bravery won a recognition from our army and from every black man in the land, is excluded from every thoroughfare of travel. Talk of giving women the ballot-box? Go on. It is a normal school, and the white women of this country need it. While there exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and selfishness, it is the white women of America." -Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, 1866

"In his 1963 'Letter from Birmingham Jail,' Martin Luther King echoed Harper's commitment to promoting a common community of interests when he wrote, 'I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states . . . . Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.' These words recall Harper's statement to the women at the 1866 Eleventh National Women's Rights Convention: 'We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity, and society cannot trample on the weakest and feeblest of its members without receiving the curse in its own soul.' Harper argued for cooperative effort among women to protect civil rights and alleviate corruption. King argued for cooperative effort among the Alabama clergymen, concerned about his disruptive presence in the city, to work against racial injustice and protect civil rights."

## [Frances Harper Bends the Arc](https://www.uua.org/re/tapestry/youth/call/workshop2/arc) ##
"Sometimes, freedom is a long time coming.

It may take generations upon generations for justice to be won. Our Unitarian ancestor Reverend Theodore Parker said, 'I do not pretend to understand the moral universe: the arc is a long one... from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.'

The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr, often used this quote. Barack Obama, 44th and first African American president of the United States added,'... but here is the thing: it does not bend on its own. It bends because each of us in our own ways put our hand on that arc and we bend it in the direction of justice....'

The hands of Unitarian Universalist have been bending the arc for many years. You may have heard of John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Christopher Reeve, or Rachel Carson. Have you heard of Frances Ellen Watkins Harper? Her hand was on the arc, too.

Harper was born a free black woman in Baltimore, Maryland in 1825. She was raised in the household of her uncle, an educator and African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister. He was also an abolitionist—a person who objected to the enslavement of blacks. Harper followed in her uncle's footsteps to become an educator and abolitionist. She also became a writer, publishing her first book of poetry at twenty and publishing the first short story by an African American woman later in life. Her writing often urged blacks, women, and people in oppressed groups to take a firm stand for equality.

In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed. It became dangerous to be a free black in Maryland because slave owners could claim black people were runaway slaves and force them into slavery. So, Harper moved farther north to Ohio and then to Philadelphia. She taught, ran part of the Underground Railroad, and lectured around the country to bend the arc toward justice for African Americans. In 1863, abolitionists celebrated success with the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. It did not immediately create a world where African Americans were treated equally and fairly, but it did make slavery illegal.

Harper saw that there was still work to be done. She put her hand toward women's civil rights, in particular the rights of black women and the right of all women to vote. She co-founded the National Association of Colored Women. Again, she toured and lectured on the topic of freedom. Her lectures and writings spoke to the need for women to be free to be more than wives and mothers. She understood what she was talking about: a mother herself, after her husband died Frances Harper took her daughter with her on her lecture tours.

During her justice work, Harper met many Unitarians also working to bend the arc. She felt at home with our liberal religious beliefs and knew that her work could strengthen the justice work of the Unitarians. She joined hands with them by joining the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia in 1870. She frequently read her poetry from the pulpit at this church, yet she kept her membership and taught Sunday school at an AME church, too.

Harper died in 1911, before the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1919. This was a cause she worked hard to bring about. Yet, Harper understood that her labors might bring about freedoms she would never enjoy. She said, 'Apparent failure may hold in its rough shell the germs of a success that will blossom in time, and bear fruit throughout eternity.' Some of the fruits of Harper's labor—and the labor of other Unitarian Universalists—are enjoyed by us today. Yet, we are not done. Oppression still exists in our world. Harper's hands—and Parker's, Adam's, Anthony's, Reeve's and Carson's—are no longer on the arc. Our hands are needed to take their place."

"Now the only way to avoid this shipwreck and to provide for our posterity is to follow the counsel of Micah; to do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with our God. We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain each other in brotherly affection...we must delight in each other; make others' condition our own, rejoice together; mourn together, labor, and suffer together...for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us; so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world...we shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us..."

"Sitting in the cab, Rachel looked out the window as Swati slept next to her and the car sat in Mumbai's never-ending traffic. Outside, the city raged and dozed and moved, always a kaleidoscope of action, as all big cities were, but as Mumbai especialy was, a writhing mass of humanity grinding and struggling against itself, as endless multiheaded snake, a hydra of a city eating itself and fighting itself day in and day out." (p. 235, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Sometimes, just as Rachel woke up, when the fan blew cooler air across her body and the world outside was somehow magically quiet, she almost thought she was in New York and not India. She forgot, for a spli second, that she was miles away, and smiled at the thought of a bagel, fresh, covered in sesame seeds and bursting with schmeer. But then something would remind her. The call of banana sellers, the thousand honks of cars and rickshaws and buses and motorcycles, a faint trill of bicycle bells, or the loud chattering of the many murders of crows perched in the palm trees, sinister voices in tropical havens." (p. 71, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

Every day was a series of puzzles Dhruv got to solve, with pleasing money-saving solutions as the reward for his efforts.

"She looked out onto the sweep of the city, the view from the highway showing her the foothills of South Mumbai, the Sea Link bridge rising dramtically over the water, tiny fishing boats dwarfed by skyscrapers, all of it somehow in the same place at once.

"All you had to do was look out your window, or get out of your rickshaw a little before your destination, and there it all was, the swirling mass of humanity all at once, in every direction. But perhaps many people, the world over, didn't een do that, when it came to life around them. And those women didn't ride in rickshaws, anyway." (p. 274, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"My wisdom tells me that this is probably so. We are all made of the same stuff, remember, we of the Jungle, you of the City. The same substance composes us - the tree overhead, the stone beneath us, the bird, the beast, the star - we are all one, all moving to the same end.

Birds and animals were now swaying together, closely encircling Mary Poppins, who was rocking lightly from side to side. Backwards and forwards went the swaying crowd, keeping time together, swinging like the pendulum of a clock. Even the trees were bending and lifting gently, and the moon seemed to be rocking in the sky as a ship rocks on the sea.

'Bird and beast and stone and star - we are all one, all one ---' murmured the Hamadryad, solftly folding his hood about him as he himself swayed between the children.

'Child and serpent, star and stone -- all one.'" (pp. 159-160, "Mary Poppins")

"You might have experienced this sense of collective union at a music festival, on the streets at a protest, or in the middle of a sports arena. Perhaps you've tried a retreat experience which has reset your perspective, or you have a mindfulness or meditation practice. Even the smallest spaces can help us connect with something greater. Before moving into our own apartment, Sean and I lived with three wonderful housemates, meaning that the only spot in our apartment where I could be assured to be alone was our dusty winter coat closet. There, amid the piles of toolboxes and snow boots, I stored my meditation cushion. For the two years we lived on Trowbridge Street, I'd climb into the closet first thing in the morning and start my meditation time by listening to a piece of music. Sixteenth-century motets like 'Ego flos campi' by Jacob Clemens non Papa and contemporary compositions like Arvo Part's haunting 'Spiegel im Speigel' brought me into a prayerful time." (p. 156, "The Power of Ritual: Turning Everyday Activities into Soulful Practices")

"Traditionally, of course adoration would have been about explicitly worshipping god. This might resonate for some, but if it doesn't, I suggest that you find ways of lifting your attention toward the larger beauty of the world, to the greater connection that holds all things. You might want to read a poem to yourself or find a small selection of music tracks that move you. And of course, if god language works for you - go for it! What matters to me is that sense of adoration of something bigger than ourselves." (p. 157, "The Power of Ritual: Turning Everyday Activities into Soulful Practices")

"Not because I was particularly sad in that moment, but because the 'I' that felt sadness had melted into something much bigger than myself that could hold all the enormity of the pain and sadness that is in any human life. The sounds of the ocean and the smell of the lavender suggested a larger presence, whichw as both me and not me, and it didn't flinch from my tears. Without being able to explain why, I felt like the universe kenw the depth of my suffering and that somehow everything would be okay.

So many of us have stories like this. We have moments in which we feel a bridge has appeared between us and something beyond. That bridge can come along when we explore a homemade ritual that we, now and then, revisit but never talk about." (p. 152, "The Power of Ritual: Turning Everyday Activities into Soulful Practices")

He likely respected the freedom from religious dogma, coercion, and fear of eternal damnation.

Spirituality was central to indigenous beliefs. Jim Beckwourth said, 'I have lived among Indians in the Eastern and Western States, on the Rocky Mountains, and in California....All believe in the same Great Spirit.' They declare that he 'sees and knows all things.'

Other observers added that Native Americans universally believed 'in one Great Spirit, who has created all things, governs all important events, who is the author of all good, and the only object of religious homage.'"

Rumors passed through Kolkata on the backs of newspapers and servants with relatives in the little towns that dotted the mangrove forests, that the tigers had stopped hunting other prey altogether, that they only focused on humans now.

Only the stars and the clear darkness of space, quite different from the fearful darkness of the Thing." (p. 102, "A Wrinkle in Time")

"Looking at the delicate painting, the rich tapestry in one corner, the open light streaming through the window and illuminating the young woman's face as she concentrated, a moment caught forever, as precise and clean as a photograph but so much deeper, so much more, he looked stunned. His mouth moved slightly, and his eyes widened, and suddenly, his whole face opened up for her, like a pair of shutters being flung back to let in the morning sun. 'I like this one,' he said, nodding, certain, authoritative. 'It's so simple, but the light. I love the light.'" (p. 75, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The sun was setting as the rickshaw ascended the highway ramp. Taking the fragile little vehicles on the highway should have terrified Rachel, but instead, it gave her a sense of exhilerated delight. She could be crushed at any moment. She could roll right out of the open sides of the rickshaw and slam her body into the highway. The interior became a wind tunnel, and she closed her eyes, inhaling the polluted air, which, nevertheless, refreshed her. Her hair whipped around her face and her eyes stung when she opened them again, but it didn't matter." (p. 271, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"The new technology increased the amount of light indoors; at the same time, the problem of lighting more generally was one that was being addressed. Across Europe, as cities expanded, and buildings grew taller, as population density increased, and as streets therefore became darker and more filled with strangers, how to light the streets became a civic preoccupation. Some cities tried to rebuild their narrow medieval streets, either widening individual routes, or, more ambitioiusly, replacing the meandering medieval roads with streets laid out in a grid pattern, to allow more moonlight to penetrate. But improving artificial lighting was a simpler, and cheaper, solution." (p. 216, "The Making of Home: The 500-Year Story of How Our Houses Became Homes", Judith Flanders)

"And while Amsteradam's street lights were fixed to the houses, Parisian street lights hung from ropes that ran across the streets of Paris were lined with more than eight thousand lights. In 1680, Prussia, too, started to experiment with street lighting, adopting yet another system. Here the lamps were hung from poles erected for the purpose, a precursor to lamp posts. Of all northern Europe's major urban centres, London lagged furthest behind. Late into the eighteenth century, its civic authorities only required lamps to be affixed to houses, without regulating the type of light, nor attempting to enforce technological improvements, as Amsterdam had. It was 1736 before London's local parishes took control of the supervision of street lighting." (p. 217, "The Making of Home: The 500-Year Story of How Our Houses Become Homes", Judith Flanders)

"Throughout the eighteenth century, most major cities, as well as smaller towns that had no official arrangements for lighting, continued to rely on link-bearers - men carrying torches of burning pitch - to cover areas where there was no street lighting, or where the dark was so profound that the lamps were inadequate. The sources of funding for street lighting predictably influenced public attitudes to link-bearers, even though these men were not paid by the city, or the government, but were in business independently. In Paris, where lighting was a police matter, the bearers were widely believed to be informers who sold information about night-movements to the police."

"Even before the appearance of these new technologies, candles had always been a luxury. In most agricultural and even many urban districts, well into the nineteenth century, most tasks were performed by firelight, including many involving skills that today are thoguht to require a bright light, such as sewing or reading. Given both the relative scarcity of windows, and, in North America, the continued use of shuttered, unglazed windows, artificial light was frequently needed indoors during the day as well as at night. As fires were necessary for cooking, they were often the primary light source as well. Candles were used chiefly to provide light when moving from one room to another, ..."

They were standing in a sunlit field, and the air about them was moving with the delicious fragrance that comes only ont he rarest of spring days when the sun's touch is gentle and the apple blossoms are just beginning to unfold.

"He was the kind of man who **believed** hismelf to be better than other people. He liked to be so. He enjoyed knowing where he stood next to others. He had liked her own moral rigidity, her disinterest in breaking with the rituals and conventions of their lives, and yet he had wanted to surpass her in them." (p. 138, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Now, though, she woke up eager to be Magda. Magda lived a life lit with courage. She was forever willing to see the best in others, to be hopeful, to open her heart." (p. 184, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Saying it would make it fine; his belief would become her reality. She would live by what other people thought, hoping their thoughts would be so strong that they would make them come true." (p. 261, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"So the doctor couldn't fix me. I figured God was going to have to. Ugh. I hated this part of faith - the part where you have to believe in something you do not see and trust something you cannot really hear. So I prayed. I prayed some heart-wrenching prayers, my friends. I cussed at God - I yelled at God. I screamed at God. I begged God. I wanted this feeling to go away. I wanted to wake up one morning and have the feelings of anxiety be gone. But they never did." (p. 102, "Kill the Spider: Getting Rid of What's Really Holding You Back", Casper ter Kuile )

"The only time I really prayed for anything was when I needed soemthing *major* in my life. At those times, I would turn on the 'I Believe in Prayer' switch. Honestly, I did believe. I prayed holes in the knees of my jeans when I suffered my anxiety attack. I prayed so hard when we went to adopt our son, Losiah. I prayed morning, noon, and night for my uncle Roger when he was diagnosed with cancer. With the massive things in life, *everyone* believes in prayer."

"What is known for certain is that Colter owned a small collection of books, which suggests his literacy. In addition, his signature appears on several public documents signed at Three Forks and St. Louis.

Many frontiersmen were literate and even well-educated. This is evident in the polished narratives they wrote describing their travels. Indeed, the numerous quotes that appear in this book attest to the fact. William Anderson said, of his travels across the Great Plains and Rockies, I saw 'gentlemen and men of genteel deportment wherever I have been.'

Joe Meek told how the mountain men gathered about the evening campfire and 'told tales of marvelous adventures, or sang some old-remembered song, or were absorbed in games of chance. Some of the better educated men, who had once known and loved books, but whom some mishap in life had banished to the wilderness, recalled their favorite authors, and recited passages once treasured, now growing unfamiliar.' Others related stories they had read in their youth, including *Robinson Crusoe*, *The Arabian Nights*, and *The Pilgrim's Progress*.

The rugged frontiersmen who traveled with William Sublette, Jedediah Smith, and David Jackson carried a copy of the Bible and the works of Shakespeare." (p. 76, "Mountain Man: John Colter, The Lewis & Clark Exedition, and the Call of the American West", David Weston Marshall)

"Knowing what you believe holds great power because you will be called upon to blaance the needs and desires and the arguments of many. A leader represents not only those who share her core values but those who despise all that she holds dear. Politics, for example, is a constant test of my capacity for learning. I know legislators who have a definite, firm, and unshakable opinion on everything before any new information is shared." (p. 171, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

"I do have core beliefs, but I don't have an unshakeable position on every issue. I accept that I may nto know enough about a situation to render immediate judgment, which is hwy I attend meetings and read everything I can. Whether you are a politican or an executive or an active citizen trying to improve your community, always keep clear in your mind the difference between policy and belief. Policy is what you should do. Belief is why you do it. But when you believe too much, you often are willing to do too little." (p. 172, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

"Truth telling, especially stories about minorities, matters. We are so frequently viewed through lenses that encourage the majority to fear us or to distrust us. That afternoon, I watched as an entire city - a nation in microcosm - heard from their news reporters to once again be afraid of black people. To believe us all to be destructive, angry, vandals rather than complex human beings who had seen in a single verdict an indictment of our humanity. If Rodney King could be beaten on tape, and his known police assailants exonerated, what would stop others from furthering our treatment as subhuman?" (p. 18, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

"The literal translation of 'metanoia' is a transformative change of heart." (p. 194, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

"The anchors of belief should never weigh down the capacity for thoughtful engagement and reasonable compromise. Effective leaders must be truth seekers, and that requires a willingnes to understand truths other than our own." (p. 170, "Lead from the Outside", Stacey Abrams)

"We lift up a young woman who sees something new in herself that she'd never recognized before. We become the sounding board for the colleage who calls to share a moment of panic: Here's how I screwed up on Thursday, and I do not want to go back into that space. Can you help me think about how to do it.'" (p. 99, "")

"My older sister, Andrea, is a college professor who teaches anthropology. One of a handful of tenured professors of color at her school, she found herself shying away from appointments to boards or committees. When she eventually conceded and joined them, one of her fears became a reality: every one of her comments, she felt had to be profound, and she thought she couldn't make any mistakes. She saw herself increasingly held to a higher standard than her white colleagues and the pressure became intense." (p. 45, "")

"I wanted to write stories about women who looked like me, ones whose lives were as exciting as anythign I'd read or seen on a movie screen. I didn't have to be Ian Fleming to tell those tales. When I let go of my fixation on crafting the piece deresistance of spy craft fiction, I found a story - and a career - that I had never imagined." (p. 23, "")

"Rachel tried to speak slowly, which was not in her nature. Her in-laws had, when she met them, look confused when she spoke, which Dhruv told her was because she had an American accent, but she privately believed was because they couldn't speak English that well." (p. 12, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"She had seen that kind of happiness in television shows and movies, that American cheer, and she had thought that was just for Westerners. But if Dhruv could find it, if he could be so close with someone, so happy from that closeness, then surely it was not a Western trait at all." (p. 20, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"'You are American. That is what American stories are like. Maybe he made it like that.'" (p. 58, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"What did all this look like to her? Swati wondered. She had seen some movies set in America, and everything looked so orderly there. The shops where you bought food were air-condition and white and everything was all together." (p. 60, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Luckily Rachel's parents were American, and couldn't tell anyone in India, therefore didn't matter, but still." (p. 87, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"But Dhruv had refused to do so. Bunny's son, Arjun, though, had gone to America for school but then come back right away and used his newfound knowledge to expand the confection factory and business, even moving the company..." (p. 94, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"'Why should I adapt to her just because she is American? She is living here,' Swati said, with more force than she intended. But it was true, wasn't it, it was what she had been telling herself day after day, that Rachel had to adapt, she had no choice. But wasn't that part of why you left Vinod? For choices?" (p. 178, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"'Not like I thought she might. It's not like America, people getting divorces all the time. We value marriage here.'" (p. 182, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Despite the American fasciation with the gutsy move, society is more likely to punish rather than praise those of us whose performances stray from a prescribed plan. Consider the athelte who uses his platform to protest injustice, the woman who takes to social media to decry sexual assault, or the ex-felon who launches a business to give prisoners access to cheaper phone calls.

The space to invent ourselves, to reimagine *our* futures is narower and soemtimes seemingly nonexistent for those who do not occupy a place of privilege. Like everything else, to defeat the problem, we have to first deconstruct the fictions of golden opportunity and realize not all worlds operate the same. We assume if we work hard, plan well, and follow the rules, we will achieve great things. At the very least, the lore tells us financial comfort awaits. For many of you reading this, you know the truth is more complicated than the illusions fed to us by this narrative. We aren't going to win playing by the written rules. So we have to discover the hidden pathways to win. I call it 'the hack' - by which I mean figuring out how to circumvent the traditioanl systems and own opportunity."

# Cultural Exchange #
"she had looked up how to pronounce each word in Hindi, they became garbled in ehr mouth and the man didn't know what she was saying, and grew confused, and she ended up angry, her face hot and her voice an octave higher than it normally was, hanging up the phone in frustration" (p. 1, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"She had joined an expat Facebook group before she moved to the city, and that had led to a few others, and now she was a member of multiple groups, which threw events and had chatty members who had lots of opinions about subjects Rachel had little interest in. People asked about where to find a summer camp for their six-year-old, or if it was better to vacation in Goa or Kerala, and at which beach and which hotel, and plugged their new business ideas and wellness sessions with earnest abandon. Rachel didn't think she would have much to say to the people discussing these new things, but facing the reality of making friends as an adult in a new city, she tried to go to the meet-ups and participate online." (p. 6, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"compared cultures like children compare baseball cards" (p. 8, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"He didn't seem to know so many of the customs; perhaps they were the domain of women, or perhaps he hadn't been paying attention gorwing up. He had lived abroad for years, too; maybe things had changed." (p. 13, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Rachel had read many books by Indian authors before she had arrived in Mumbai, trying to fill the gaps in her knowledge and in Dhruv's descriptions with information. She had never been to India before she moved, and now she realized that perhaps that had been a good thing." (p. 13, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

"Listening intently, she heard murmuring in the living room, words she didn't understand, a conversation in Hindi. She heard more Hindi than English most days; it was a shame she still hadn't learned much. She wasn't good with languages, not like Dhruv was. Everything just passed her by; she could feel things washing over her, nothing sticking in her mind." (p. 42, "Mother Land", Leah Franqui)

# Infrastructure #
"The streets of Mumbai were bumpy with potholes, speed bumps to slow down fast-moving motorcycles and derail bicycle delivery boys. Every few seconds a bump or depression would rip through the car, jolting Rahcel and Swati against each other. Each woman clutched the side of the car as a matter of course. The seat belts never functioned in these cars, or the black-and-yellow taxis, let alone a rickshaw. As she had grown older, Swati had felt her body protesting Kolkata's ill-kept streets, but somehow Mumbai, wealthy, shiny Mumbai, was even worse. Looking out, though the breeze from the sea caught the trees and the sun felt strong, even though it was autumn. That was nothing like Kolkata's chilly gloom, and Swati found herself smiling out into the bright day, enjoying how the light hit the bright magenta bougainvillea growing like weeds from every balcony and over every fence."

# The Art of Ecology #
## [The Art of Ecology](https://intercongreen.com/2012/09/12/the-art-of-ecology/) ##
"Irons finds her inspiration for her work in the complexities of natural ecologies and their interconnected component, leaving it as no surprise that I was drawn to her work immediately. One of her fascinating collections grew from the notion of bird migration related to the loss of habitat from human development. These events can cause evolutions, or even the outright collapse, of ecosystems overtime that may ultimately find their way to regrowth. Ellie walked me through the first piece in the series that works with pencil and water on paper that is collaged with pieces of vintage bird guides. A network of branch-like forms gives birth to the color and shape of birds as it evolves across the three pages of the piece before fading out with only a hint of possible rejuvenation at the end. This series evolved into a “night” migration collection that I was particularly drawn to as well.

When she is not producing innovative artwork in her studio she also teaches art to both college students at City College and second graders as a resident artist at the Learning Through Art Program at the Guggenheim."

"Ellie showed me another piece that took a different angle in reflecting on the interface and overlap between the natural and the man-made. Done in a combination of ink and watercolor, the composition has a rhythm generated by the diamonds of chain link fence over a field of colored tones with reversed silhouettes of plant life behind–the delicate overlap of leaves and stems inherently striking the parallel between the more rigid lines of twisted metal. On the right her birds return with a fluid form that resembles a completed bird at one point but dissolves into fence at one end and towards the network of leaves at the other. To me, the piece clearly highlighted how inseparable the environments of civilization and nature are with each unavoidably affecting the other.  I encourage anyone and everyone to take a more thorough look at her website.

Given that Ellie is an artist with interested in ecology and urban restoration, I had to ask her opinion of the Highline (which I think is extraordinary)."

"When asked if there were artists that had served as inspiration for her when it came to her ecological focus or natural media, she had an ample list. She mentioned Newton & Helen Mayer Harrison who work closely with the fields of ecology and biology to promote biodiversity and community development. Also included were Mark Dion and Agnus Denes. One of Denes’ most well known projects was the installation of a wheat field in the New York Battery Park landfill in 1982–grain that would ultimately be harvested at travel to 28 cities in a work that the artist described as commenting on “human values and misplaced priorities.”

Ellie’s work takes on a difficult task: trying to depict the connections of systems that are almost too complicated to describe, but the depth of her composition conveys the amount of information that operates behind the scenes. Again, despite the fact that Ellie Iron’s artwork and the informational resource of Intercon have missions that are closely related, the delivery is meaningfully different–but that could be a good thing. The more ways we can try to convey what is important, the underlying force of sustainability and why it is essential, the better chances we have of conveying more knowledge to more people. If anyone else has artists whose work operates in a similar vein, please share them as well."
