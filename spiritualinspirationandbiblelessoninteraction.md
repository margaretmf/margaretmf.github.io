## I love reading the Christian Science Quarterly Bible Lesson and studying it. In the year 2021, I am trying to interact with it online. ##

## Week of December 28, 2020 - 'God' - Inspiring Passages ##

* I am free to be joyful in the name of the Lord, God, the consciousness of good throughout the day in all my works.

"In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted."


* God understands me, my heart, and all my needs. 

"The Lord is gracioius, and full of compassion;"


* God is blessing everyone, and there's harmonious action for everyone in all our works.

I seek to do the right thing, and go to God to say the right thing in everything I do. I do not need to be anxious about anything, I turn to God to know the right thing to do, and the right thing to say or write.
"he Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works."


* I am wedded to the consciousness of good, divine Love. I am employed by God.

"For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called."


* I turn to Christ the king. The Christ is the voice of peace, not anxiety. I can feel the Christ within me and within everyone. God is king over everyone.

"the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one."


* God is God to everyone.

"God is one." // "one universal Good, the invisible good dwelling in eternal Science."


* God is everywhere, healing us from burnout, anxiety, or there when we seek after him.

"Hast thou not known? hast thou not hear, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding."
"they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
"When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them. I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together: That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it."


* Healing from impotence, spitefulness, striking back, hitting back, willfulness

"Wilt thou be made whole? The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked:"


* No possibility for anxiety, social anxiety, pain, false wants

"I and my Father are one."


* Freeing from narcissism, egotism

"When will the ages understand the Ego, and realize only one God, one mind or intelligence?"


* I am intelligent, and can tap into a divine sense of intelligence

"The understanding that the Ego is Mind, and that there is but one Mind or intelligence, begins at once to destory the errors of mortal sense and to supply the truth of immortal sense. This understanding makes the body harmonious; it makes the nerves, bones, brain, etc., servants, instead of masters."


* A prisoner of the Lord, not chained to anything or anyone else

"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,'
"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."


* Being and feeling led to heal people by God; God leads us to heal

"Having one God, one Mind, unfolds the power that heals the sick, and fulfiles these sayings of Scripture, 'I am the Lord that healeth thee,' and 'I have found a ransom.'"


* One Father-Mother God, Lord of us all, we share the same ancestry, heritage, loyalty, spirit in the Spirit, and we can see this essence expressed

"Jesus acknowledged no ties of the flesh. He said: 'Call no man your father upont he earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.'"
"Again he asked: 'Who is my mother, and who are my brethren,' implying that it is they who do the will of his Father."
"We have no record of his calling any man by the name of father. He recognized Spirit, God, as the only creator, and therefore as the Father of all."
"the healing power of Truth and Love"
"Be firm in your understanding that the divine Mind governs, and that in Science man reflects God's government."


* Employed by God, to know everyone as God's daughters and sons

"truthful arguents you employ", "spirit of Truth and Love", "heal the sick"
"The Christian Scientist's argument rests on the Christianly scientific basis of being. The Scripture declares, 'The Lord He is God [good]; there is none else beside Him.'"


* Seeking a higher sense of good, light

"As mortals reach, through knowledge of Christian Science, a higher sense, they will seek to learn, not from matter, but from the divine Principle, God, how to demonstrate the Christ, Truth, as the healing and saving power."


* The kingdom of heaven is within, a consciousness of God

"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well"
"Our Father which art in heaven,
Our Father-Mother God, all-harmonious,
Hallowed by Thy name.
Adorable One."
