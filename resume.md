## PROFILE 
At the University of Virginia, a public university founded by the author of the Declaration of Independence, I received a dual degrees in the liberal arts. I am most passionate about communications in the field of technology and the liberal arts perspective in the real world. I believe in the core values of lifelong learning and a renaissance education that the founder of the University of Virginia taught and shared not only with students but also the country.

I am a versatile creative and content writer, sketcher, interviewer, programmer, and data analyst, with an interest in writing, teaching, the business world, STEAM education, liberal arts education, and current events. I am enthusiastic about helping people and standing witness to the innate goodness in our world.
