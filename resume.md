## PROFILE 
I am a versatile professional, interested in writing to support technology and business development, interviewing people, and analyzing data. I am a graduate of the University of Virginia, a public university founded by the author of the Declaration of Independence, where I received dual degrees in the liberal arts (and sciences). I believe in the core values of lifelong learning and a renaissance education, which the founder of the University of Virginia taught and shared, not only with students, but also the country.
