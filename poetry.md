I am not a naturally verbal thinker. I am more naturally a visual thinker, and it has taken me a long time in life to learn how to express my feelings in a world where expressing feelings is not ok. I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering.


## The Ocean ##
The ocean.
Deep, vast waters that touch the brown earth.
Waves of different heights flow in flux.
Like how the currents move around, God causes his people to move.
Like how the tide rises and lowers, God causes us to wake up.
The ocean.
The ocean represents the deep waters of God within man's soul.
The green, blue, grey, white is the substance of thought connecting us all in consciousness between the foundations of the earth.


## Clouds ##
The clouds. 
They sit like a blanket covering the sky, and looking like puff, they sit in the sky for a divinely childlike adventure.
The clouds.
They hold the water and the mist.
And when there is a lot of water, they become thunderheads.
The clouds.
They are so beautiful in the sky.
People imagine different things about them and how they support our ecosystem.


## First Love ##
The flame of love within shows me the way to have fun with life and cherish the light within all around.
The source within is tender, and I relish the youthlike energy that everyone yearns to feel.


## Spring ##
A fresh season for living, moving, and loving begins.
The pink buds, the white and yellow flowers.
From little seeds to full openings, it is perennial as the primrose.


## A Tree ##
The tree that stands in front of my house has roots that go deep into the ground.
The branches expand outwardly and onwardly into the sky.
The tree comes from a forest, the woods.
The little sapling holds it strong.
The timber keeps it steady.


## A Storm ##
The storm is roaring and raging in the sky and in our hearts.
The blustering winds, the tempestuous feelings.
There is nothing like a witner blast, and a heart filled with wrath that loses control.
The storm roars without us, the sun is always shining, and it is always a beautiful world to be joyful, and cheerful in.


## A Sunny Day ##
A sunny day is like God smiling through the day.
God's light shines through our land and our hearts.
Each man, each individual can see the sun radiating from a slightly different perspective.
All of mankind can bask in the light of God, this sun that shines through the day in brilliant ways.
We can all choose to appreciate the summery sense of life. 


## Anger ##
The feelings of guilt and shame turn to anger. 
My heart rages inside.
I cannot control it.
I feel vexation. 
That's all I feel.
I feel like I am inferior to others and delayed, and the sense of being caged in makes me feel frustrated, and thwarted.
The darkness inside - I cannot hide it for much longer.
The darkness is lurking, and I can't shove it down.
"I should feel ashamed of myself and embarassed" is all I hear people voice.
The shame and embarassament turn to anger and rage. 
There is enmity towards what God is doing and what I want.
I am committing malice by giving into the raging heart.
Nothing is stronger and more dangerous than this indignation and sense of injustice.
But expressing gratitude for every ounce of good turns around the monstrous storm.


## Sadness ##
It's a huge nightmare, a shock to the whole bodily system.
Heartache, grief, woe, bleekness, and wanting to yell out of sadness.
Crying but choosing to love beyond the grief, the tears.
Everything feels broken and despondent, but everything is still in tact, and there is still so much goodness and mercy.
Sadness cannot overtake me.
Only Love overcomes.
There's always more beauty, and good cheer to wake up to.


## Joy ##
Joy comes from opening a window to the sun.
I choose to be cheerful and appreciate a new day.
I live with glee and delight because there's fresh space to shut out the noise.
Elation comes when dancing and having a good time.


## Tears ##
I weep inside.
There's so much pain in my heart.
I want to cry, and I feel the tears.
It's so hard to see the pictures, the images.
I grieve over rejection after trying to do what's right.
How did I go wrong?
How do I love?
Loving people heals the distress, the wailing, and the whimpering.
The tears flow out, but I let a smile, and a laugh, and a dance have the last word.


## Rain ##
The rain falls down onto the windowshield.
It showers.
The water falls in a torrent.
It's a deluge of water.
Precipitatory, changing form from the sky to the earth.
The sprinkles, the droplets.
The sunshine wants to evaporate the water after it falls.


## Illness ##
Illness sucks the life out of people.
Illness is a great malady.
There is breakdown, affliction, ailing, disability, relapse.
Illness is emotional wailing, cellular destruction, tears, pain.
It leads people to want to die.
But recovery is normal, a desire to sing is normal.
Illness leads to perfect health, recovery.


## Smiles ##
Smiles are God's work through man.
The sun shines its light that radiates through the Earth as man shines its happiness through a smile.
There should be 7.2 billiion smiles, laughs, expressions of delight, and beams of hope on Earth today.
Smiling through all the Earth, our mankind is beautiful, whole, integrated.


## Music ##
Life is a symphony.
The breeze moves the trees, and cars move around on the highway in a beautifully orchestrated way.
There is constant rhythm when we tune into the underlying reality and let ourselves be instrument of good cheer.
There is constant melody in the interconnectedness of Life.
Our experience is a living hymn.


## Hope ##
A hope, a desire for something - something better.
A wish for something to happen.
A belief in the best.
An aspiration, a life goal, optimism nd faith that everything will work together for the best.
Anticipation of harmony, love, God's care, God's detailed plan.
An expectation of being in the right place.


## Mortality ##
The fatal pull to feel compressed, stuck, ashamed, heavy, guilt-ridden.
The lethal ull to attack, attach, react, and be indignant.
Life is beautiful, beauty is immortal, grace comes to us unexpectedly.
Paradise of heaven is within.
The passing storm, the passing clouds.
The darkness, the storminess of the night can not touch us.
In sure repose I find the way.
In deep silence, I appreciate the music of God.
In sleep, despite the heaviness and pull towards death, I feel the touch of eternity.


## Heaven ##
Heaven is here, not somewhere out there.
Heaven covers the earth and the sky.
Heaven in our hearts feels like the expanse of the sky.
Heaven is the glory of the reign of God's kingdom.
Heaven exists for eternity for us all.
Heaven is pure bliss and exists well beyond the current present, it exists hereafter.
Heaven gives its eternal rest.


## Parents ##
Parents, the guardians and educators of youth.
They bring mankind up to know what is right spiritualy and morally.
Childhood is protected by nurturing motherhood and protective fatherhood.
Parents teach what is right, or real, from wrong or unreal.
God, good, is the parent mind for everyone.


## Children ##
Children, the sound of children playing is beautiful.
It's so natural to appreciate youth.
Youth rise to love and teach us to love more.
Little kids are so deep and eloquent in their understanding of spirituality.
Toddlers look deep into our souls, and play with us to help us feel more alive and joyful.
The changing seasons, the next generation, the progression of umanity, and mankind, is reflected through youth.


## Home ## 
Home starts from within.
Activities in a house, a community, workplace flow out from home within.
The love of the house reflects the love of the home within.
Great is the joy of conversations near the light of the fireside.
Great is the delight of cooking in the kitchen.
Great is the grace of working from home in the cottage.
A home contributes to a village.


## Work ##
Rising up ot of bed with the morning sun shining through the city to do the daily duties.
There's a song and a whistle in the daily grind.
Finding the fun in the tool makes it worthwhile.
I exert myself, use my skills, put in the effort, and have fun.

## Time ##
Outside of time, stands eternity.
Tale as old as time.
The hours of the period stand for the goodness expressed through acts.
An era of sunlight unfolding.
Taking back the night where the clock runs towards the right side of history.
Tick-tock it goes, for infinity.
For infinity, our truth will march onward.
And moment by moment, we choose to stand in that goodness.


## The Past ##
The past is done. It's gone. It's a distant dream, a memory fading away so that the past of new mercies can unfold.
Let by gones teach us the lessons while holding on to remembrances of the good.
Nothing is born of ruminating about what happened long ago or regretting past actions.
The present is here to be made new.
The cycle of light continues through history forever.


## The Future ##
No one knows waht the future will bring.
We put our hope in the prsoepcts of a better day tomorrow.
We carry the weight of concerns over imminent threats to our being next week.
We trust that there are opporunties for new modes of life in a year.
Prophesying for good, not for evil, shall be our goal in the uncertaity and questioned destiny.
Our fate is good, and the cycle of light continues forever out of the darkness.
