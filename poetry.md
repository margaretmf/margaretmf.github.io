## The Ocean ##
The ocean.
Deep, vast waters that touch the brown earth.
Waves of different heights in flux.
As the currents move around, God causes his people to move.
As the tide rises and lowers, God causes us to wake up.
The ocean.
The ocean represents the deep waters of God within man's soul.
Green, blue, grey, white, it is the substance of thought connecting us all in consciousness between the foundations of the earth.
