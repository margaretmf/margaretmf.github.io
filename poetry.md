I am not a naturally verbal thinker. I am more naturally a visual thinker, and it has taken me a long time in life to learn how to express my feelings in a world where expressing feelings is not ok. I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering.


## The Ocean ##
The ocean.
Deep, vast waters that touch the brown earth.
Waves of different heights flow in flux.
Like how the currents move around, God causes his people to move.
Like how the tide rises and lowers, God causes us to wake up.
The ocean.
The ocean represents the deep waters of God within man's soul.
The green, blue, grey, white is the substance of thought connecting us all in consciousness between the foundations of the earth.


## Clouds ##
The clouds. 
They sit like a blanket covering the sky, and looking like puff, they sit in the sky for a divinely childlike adventure.
The clouds.
They hold the water and the mist.
And when there is a lot of water, they become thunderheads.
The clouds.
They are so beautiful in the sky.
People imagine different things about them and how they support our ecosystem.


## First Love ##
The flame of love within shows me the way to have fun with life and cherish the light within all around.
The source within is tender, and I relish the youthlike energy that everyone yearns to feel.


## Spring ##
A fresh season for living, moving, and loving begins.
The pink buds, the white and yellow flowers.
From little seeds to full openings, it is perennial as the primrose.


## A Tree ##
The tree that stands in front of my house has roots that go deep into the ground.
The branches expand on into the sky.
The tree comes from a forest, the woods.
The little sapling holds it strong.
The timber keeps it steady.


## A Storm ##
The storm is roaring and raging in the sky and in our hearts.
The blustering winds, the tempestuous feelings.
There is nothing like a witner blast, and a heart filled with wrath that loses control.
The storm roars without us, the sun is always shining, and it is always a beautiful world to be joyful, and cheerful in.


## A Sunny Day ##
A sunny day is like God smiling through the day.
God's light shines through our land and our hearts.
Each man, each individual can see the sun radiating from a slightly different perspective.
All of mankind can bask in the light of God, this sun that shines through the day in brilliant ways.
We can all choose to appreaciate the summery sense of life. 


## Anger ##
The feelings of guilt and shame turn to anger. 
My heart rages inside.
I cannot control it.
I feel vexation. 
That's all I feel.
I feel like I am inferior to others and delayed, and the sense of being caged in makes me feel frustrated, and thwarted.
The darness inside - I cannot hide it for much longer.
The darkness is lurking, and I can't shove it down.
"I should feel ashamed of myself and embarassed" is all I hear people voice.
The shame and embarassament turn to anger and rage. 
There is enmity towards what God is doing and what I want.
I am committing malice by giving into the raging heart.
Nothing is stronger and more dangerous than this indignation and sense of injustice.
But expressing gratitude for every ounce of good turns around the monstrous storm.


## Sadness ##
It's a huge nightmare, a shock to the whole bodily system.
Heartache, grief, woe, bleekness, and wanting to yell out of sadness.
Crying but choosing to love beyond the grief, the tears.
Everything feels broken and despondent, but everything is still in tact, and there is still so much goodness and mercy.
Sadness cannot overtake me.
Only Love overcomes.
There's always mroe beauty, and good cheer to wake up to.


## Joy ##
Joy comes from oening a window to the sun.
I chose to be cheerful and appreciate a new day.
I live with glee and delight because there's fresh space to shut out the noise.
Elation comes when dancing and having a good time.


## Tears ##
I weep inside.
There's so much pain in my heart.
I want to cry, and I feel the tears.
It's so hard to see the pictures, the images.
I grieve over rejection after trying to do what's right.
How did I go wrong?
How do I love?
Loving people heals the distress, the wailing, the whimpering.
The tears flow out, but I let a smile, and a laugh, and a dance have the last word.


## Rain ##
The rain falls down onto the windowshield.
It showers.
The water
