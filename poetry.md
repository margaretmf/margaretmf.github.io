**I was grateful in high school for an English teacher in high school who taught creative writing, and I was grateful for another English teacher in high school who taught the American Credo Project. I did not particularly enjoy creative writing, but I love that creative writing supports people who have experienced "moral hangovers" or have been imprisoned.**

## Home ##

**I am interested in music lyrics that represent Freedom, Women's Independence, The Union, and I am exploring with these words.**

## Taking Back the Night ##
Flying into the night sky, I take back the night, where the night in reality is a silent night.
I sing with the stars, where everyone has a place.
In the depth of the darkness of the night, the light shines through the window, and the stars glitter and shine, and light the path.
I know I am held so tightly because of how brightly the light shines.

## Prison in Home ##
Before the quarantine, I became a prison in my own home.
I felt like I was quarantined before the quarantine.
I felt like I was imprisoned before being imprisoned.
I felt like I was ostracized, yet connected before feeling close to losing it all.
I am compassionate, but I became something that does not represent my true self.
I am genuine and real, but I became fake, a fraud, and spiteful.
I was afraid, I felt hurt from opening up.
God was there, but I was not paying full attention.
He was right, goodness was running after me, and angels proved that "goodness was running after me",
but willfulness took over and used me.
Knowing what's right, but doing what's wrong will lead to prison.
Complaining when I could pause, and being grateful will lead to prison.

## The Confederate Flag ##

## The Country Music and the Rejection ##
Did it heal your relationship to the Country or the country?
It healed my relationship to the Country and the country.
I was already from the South, but negative memories of the South and race infiltrated my thought.
I already loved the sound of the trains, but it brought me closer to the nation-wide railways.
I was already aware of the lumber industry, but it brought me one step closer to it.
I already knew Tennessee and bluegrass music, but it brought me one step closer to the Blues.
I was already from Virginia, but it shed light on West Virginia, nearby, and brought me one step closer to Old Virginia.
I thought I was relating to the South, but it made me aware of the West.
I had already been to South America, but it brought me more love for the South Americans.
I had already been to Scotland and Ireland, but it woke up my memories of a love for Scottish music.
I had already traveled to the West to visit the natives, but it called my attention to the greater whole.
I had already felt denied by Southern culture, but it woke me up to my Southern mamma.
I was already aware of the trucks at the Port and on the roads, but it led me to love the truck drivers more.
I had thought Country music was just for White People, but I realized I already listened to country music produced by Black people.
I denied that the music was for me, and prayed that there was another woman the song was for.
I felt for him, and loved his heart, but felt guilt, rejected, and ignored, and ashamed, and I grew stronger.
When listening more deeply, it reminded me of the guy next door, and woke me up to how he viewed the world.
I had already felt eternity, but I felt eternity for the whole country, all the people, and the touch of eternity I felt in my darkest hours.

## The Union ##
The red, white, and blue, where brown cadillacs and red trucks drive on the same roads.
Weaving in and out through the cities and the land, we all live in one country under the God in which we trust.

## America ## 
Digging into the depth of the earth, wedded to the earth,
where the soil is thick
and knows her story
and leaves room for all to grow in their own way.

## The Lone Bird ##
The bird flies in solitude across the land.
It lifts its wings alone so gracefully.
I'd like to be like that lone bird, unafraid to show dignity on the fence, possessed by her quiet strength.
Not heartbroken when he breaks my heart.
Not angry when he ignores my words.
Not startled when he has a new friend.
But relieved that I can fly freely with love and peace in my heart, and still sing my song too.
No song is too simple. No song is too advanced. All of humanity is singing a song with this lone bird on the fence.
My heart soars higher, my eyes look deeper, my vision grows further when he lets go.

## Fighting for Independence ##
Let go of the gun.
let the reign of Truth and Love in.
Fighting for Independence, where there is ground beneath my feet,
trust, love, and joy in the depths of my soul,
goodness that is greater than evil
and a light that embraces everything through all the Earth.

## The Rose Within ##
There is a rose within everyone's heart.
It must be watered, it must be nourished.
The love is strong, and the light is bright, even at night. It is all one with all of humanity.

## Healing from Abuse, both the Abused and the Abuser ##
There was no reason to be jealous.
You have it all within, sister.
The qualities are there. The latent talent is there.
You may blossom differently or later, but sister, you spring from the same source, and the ideas are there.
So love your brother, and love your sister. Love must go before you, and you are not estranged.
Sometimes the night must be taken back, the fight within must stop, and the time to be receptive must come.
God does amazing work through the pain, and really opens us up to Her living reality.

## Healing from The Tendency to Fight ##

## Healing from Weird Words ##

## Opening Up, Anger, Strife ##

## Same Roads, New View ##
I have driven down these roads before
but I see them, the people, the homes in a new light.
Everything grows richer, deeper, fuller, and more alive.
I see the beauty, not the poverty.

## Letting It Go and Moving On ##
When he let me go, I got in the car.
I drove through Bristol, Nashville, Memphis, and across the Arkansas Bridge to West Memphis.
Then I drove through Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and the Rust Belt, across another bridge over the Ohio River.
I met some new friends, stayed in some hotels, heard some new stories, read some new books, saw new artwork,
and traveled back down West Virginia Country Roads, where everything felt like home in a new way.
Driving by the train tracks, feeling the freshness of the Rivers, and seeing the Americans doing their work,
America felt new, yet the same.
I remembered my family, and the deep, deep roots that run through the ground.
I saw why people want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, but it has always been great and will always be great.

## It Starts At the Port ##
It starts at the port.
Every morning, the orange, green, and blue trucks drive from the shipyard to the streets.
The trucks drive harmoniously down Hampton Roads like the birds do when they fly.
Where do they go? From the port city to the country roads.
A beautiful chain of freight traveling from the port cities to the country.

## Home and Music ##
Home is where it all begins.
There's a place for music and you all in my heart forever.
Childlike memories of light, dancing, and merriment last forever.
No hurt can reach the child within, we all express this sweet, childlike innocence.

## The Sound of Silence ##
The sound of silence is so grand, so great, so beautiful.
In the silence, I can hear the greatest music, the greatest song of all.
In the silence, I feel the leaves, the rain, the sun, the breeze, the road, the trucks, the goodness of all the people on both side of politics.
I made myself vulnerable, started opening up, felt guilt and then shame, and then embarassment, then violent, and then anger.
I opened up in the wrong way.
There was silence, no response, feelings of inferiority. I fell, and stooped so low in violence.
I rose up higher with a bounce in my step, a love for someone else, and a resilient sense of being.
I tried to apologize, I saw more deeply, learned grander lessons, and felt the true sound of silence in my own heart rather than the sound of silence coming from someone not accepting of me reaching out.
Every heart is so beautiful, and I know this true sound of silence is within everyone's heart, but the false beliefs, the dark clouds cover the true sound of silence.

## The Agitation in America ##
When the riots fell down on the White house, the breakdowns happened at the Confederate Monuments, and the sense of loss and of lack stirred up agitation,
the American dream felt out of reach to people.
The American dream is not lost.
America, founded on a rock, will always represent freedom to humanity.
Have no fear, American people, we are all God's sons and daughters, and there's a new day under the Sun.
What's great about America remains great.
What needs to be known about America will be known.
The dross of the country will be removed, and the gold of the country will be refined and come to the surface.
There's newness for the country coming to the surface.
There's grace, equity, equality, and justice for today.
The governors represent the people, all the people.
Nothing is lost, nothing about America's roots are being displaced.
Everyone in the country belongs - all races, all creeds, all cultures, all religions.
America, a melting pot, belongs to the English settlers, the Irish immigrants, the Scottish explorers, the African freedom-finders and Soul-givers, the Italians, the Chinese scientists, the Indian engineers and food-makers, the Jewish, the Muslim.
We were and can all be immigrants made new, we were and can all be explorers, we were and can all be settlers finding our place to settle, rest and be at peace, we were and can all be freedom-finders, no matter our background.
Americans, tied to the land, has a new day in the sun.
The land belongs to everyone.
America is not at the center, but represents freedom-finding, for all ethnic backgrounds and races.

**A Poem on Black Lives**
## Seeing Black Lives ##
They help the police force as police officers.
They play music.
They read in church.
They create amazing art.
They help the homeless community.
They take care of little kids and love them, and hug them.

They are great sorority formal partners.
They create art and music.
They dance in the street.
They love their work.
They support their kids.
They have healthy, beautiful homes.
They love Allah, the same God that Christians worship.
They also love God, and they have great faith through adversity.


**A Poem on Social Media**
Why look her, or him up one more time? 
Lurking on social media; why lurk behind the scenes again?
I put a stop to the lurking, and control my usage.

The images are beautiful; I am receiving Christmas Cards all years.
It's a place to express love, and appreciation, and meet people from a distance.
It's a place to see the beauty and childlike grace and innocence expressed in everyone.
People express joy in amazing ways and share that with everyone online.

But why open up so much to strangers from a distance?
Use wisdom, carefulness, and caution.
Don't be someone from the outside looking in through the window you should not look through.

Be someone on the inside, being safe, being a friend to those you know.
Share photos like a Christmas Card, but limit the usage to those you know.

**A Poem on Prayer for Humanity**

<br>


**I am not a naturally verbal thinker. I am more naturally a visual thinker, and it has taken me a long time in life to learn how to express my feelings in a world where expressing feelings, or opening up is not ok. I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering. Earlier in 2020, and before 2020, I was sending aggressive emails, but my sister realized that some of my attacks had a poetic sound underlying them. Some people don't feel like expressing feelings is ok, and that feelings must be worked out independently; but feelings must be expressed, others express feelings through music, and poetry is a good tool for expressing feelings verbally.
