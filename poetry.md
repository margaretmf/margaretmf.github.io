## I was grateful in high school for an English teacher in high school who taught creative writing, and I was grateful for another English teacher in high school who taught the American Credo Project. I did not particularly enjoy creative writing, but I love that creative writing supports people who have experienced "moral hangovers" or have been imprisoned.** I used to experience mental breakdowns, not say enough, or say or write too much, sometimes out of anger, so I have turned to writing poetry to work through feelings. Some people have discovered that The Psalmist is the best therapist, so I am trying out my own poetry. ##

## Taking Back the Night ##
Flying into the night sky, I take back the night, where the night in reality is a silent night.
I sing with the stars, where everyone has a place.
In the depth of the darkness of the night, the light shines through the window, and the stars glitter and shine, and light the path.
I know I am held so tightly because of how brightly the light shines.

## Prison in My Own Home ##
Before the quarantine, I became a prisoner in my own home.
I felt like I was quarantined before the quarantine.
I felt like I was imprisoned before being imprisoned.
I felt like I was ostracized, yet connected before feeling close to losing it all.
I am compassionate, but I became something that does not represent my true self.
I am genuine and real, but I became fake, a fraud, and spiteful.
I was afraid, I felt hurt from opening up.
I hated my sexuality.
God was there, but I was not paying full attention.
He was right, goodness was running after me, and angels proved that "goodness was running after me",
but willfulness, heaviness, and pain took over and used me.
Knowing what's right, but doing what's wrong will lead to prison.
Complaining when I could pause, and being grateful will lead to prison.
Hitting back when I can forgive will lead to prison.

## A Poem for a Marriage, a Wedding ##
In your weddedness to God,
your union eternal exists
in a house undivided.

In weddedness to God,
I am grateful to share
happiness with Mary for 
3 generations of Furr women.

What blesses one blesses all,
so the union can only bless everyone." 

## A New Day ##
It's a new day 
Open your window to the sunlight
Take a deep breath and smile
Welcome humanity, and the world into your heart with love
Close the door to peering into the lives of others
Trust they are right where they are meant to be

## A New Day ##
It is a new day,
the fan is blowing,
the water is running,
the sound of silence plays in the background.

I made mistakes, reacted out of anger yesterday, yet again.

But the sun is dawning on a new day, and I can choose to reform, and let go.

The sun is shining on the Earth from a new angle, shedding new perspectives on things.

## Mortal Mind and Divine Mind ##
Mortal mind wants to assert itself through fear, through judgment, through offense, through threat.
Divine Mind asserts itself through peace, through compassion, through empathy, through understanding, through patience, through prayer.
Mortal mind wants to control through pressure, through anger, through manipulation, through jealousy.
Divine Mind wants to control through morality, through the consciousness of good, through helpfulness, through good character.

## The Ocean ##
The ocean crashes every day upon the shore.
The deep waters of God are where the sin is stirred out.
And the holiness of God can cleanse what is wrong away.

## Connected, Yet Ostracized ##
When I am feeling connected yet ostracized, I want to yell out, but I pause 
to remember the values to live out with the connections, not the connections themselves.

## I AM ##
I’m a graduate of UVA. 
I’m a breakthrough thinker.
I’m a community member. 
I’m a musician. 
I am a church member.
I am studious. 
I am organized. 
I seek to be compassionate.
I can be a people pleaser. 
I can be impatient.
I sometimes react.
I empathize. 
I have strong feelings.
I sometimes feel tempted to manipulate situations.
God works through me. 
I am equal to all mankind. 
I am a child lover. 
I have an inner poet. 
I am a visual thinker. 
I see the latent talent in people. 
I am an engineer, I am a collaborator and a team member, not a competitor. 
I am a graduate of UVa, and Thomas Jefferson never worked in a silo. He worked across disciplines and founded democracy. I do too. 
People box people in. 
I try not to be elitist. 
I love egalitarianism.
I don’t worship people. But sometimes I feel like people are superior to me, and sometimes I have felt I am superior to others. 
I worship the song of Love at the post office, and the Fed Ex office.
I love that I am Southern. 

This. Is. Who. I am. 

## The Darkness ##
In the dark, when I am all alone
The light flashing through the car in front of me can't scare me
The light within guiding me with intelligence, peace, security is so strong as the light flashing through the car

## Words Cannot Express ##
Words cannot express the deep things of God.
Awareness of the Christ is key to healing.
God moves people with compassion to discover the Christ expressed in everyone.

## Confidence ##
"with faith"..."in God"
Being so one with God that one can be happy for all of those around you.
Being able to express help to someone who seems to be struggling and being confident in his or her ability.
Feeling at ease in the body.
Being able to admit to mistakes and accept rebukes with joy for how to become better.
Being so rooted in God that there's no reason to react because there's a knowledge that God's idea is fit somehwere.
Being free from the pull to compare or judge or feel judged.

## Forgiveness ##
Forgiveness, returning to the original, the point of origin, the home, where all are welcome, trusted, brethren, sharing happiness, sharing the same Father-Mother.

## The Healing ##
The healing is there; it's already within
There's nothing to change; just the true ideas welling within to ressurect and live

## Life Lessons and the Next Generation ##
Life lessons are continuing in beautiful ways through the next generation.

## Divine Right ##
It's your divine right to be free, whole, singing, healed, joyful, purposeful, employed.

## Morality ##
Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of good, and doing good, where there exists only the righteous thoughts, not the thoughts of want.
Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of joy, and being joyful, where there exists only the desire to see the light in others and be grateful and happy for them.
Is the act life-giving? Then it's morally right.
Is the act loving? Then it's morally just.
Is the act truthful, honest, factual, and just? Then it's morally correct.
Is the act principled, ordered, and balanced? Then it's moral.
The place within where there's moral freedom is where there's a consciousness so filled with love and light, and no room for fear. anger, false judgment, want, or disappointment.

## "Love Chases the Storms Away"
Love and life within chases the storms away.
After the storm, the tree branches lie on the ground.
The leaves have fallen, and the rain has gone away.
The sun reflects through the puddles on the ground.
The water evaporates in the sun that shines.
The residue from the storms falls way.
Life continues with freshness.
The light of love and life chases the storm away, leaving no room for negativity, and only gives room for rebirth and renewal.

## Quarantine - Creativity, Regeneration, Rebirth, and Home ##

## Religious Liberty ##
Christian Science embraces all religions, all churches, all races, and all of humanity.
The Christian Science church architecture roots itself in Romanesque architecture.
America does too. America was founded with a love for religious freedom and religious liberty, though there are debates over what this means to people.
The architecture in Charlottesville was rooted in Roman architecture.
I love all the churches, I love all the people, and I love that God forgives everyone and speaks to everyone.

## Opening Up ##
Opening up to people about the negative thoughts, beliefs in the back of my thought, and things I should not say, feel, or believe. 
How do I work through these thoughts, beliefs, and things?
Opening up, feeling over-exposed, feeling naked, literally or metaphorically.
It leads to discomfort, something to shove down, or anger, and I express anger.
This is not true opening up. This opening up is the discarding of darkness to be transformed into light.

Opening up to the Holy Spirit, sense of joy, compassion, life, and childlikeness.
This spirit of man, born of the Holy Spirit, is within everyone.
It is reflected through the shadows in the back of people's thoughts, shining brighter than the shadows.
It is greater than the physical appearance of man.
Opening up to the sense of love within opens us up to people correctly to open up to the love within another.
Opening up to the light causes man's eyes to light up with a sparkle and a glow.
This is true opening up.

## The Democratic Republic and the Debate Inside My Head ##

## Children's Play and Hallucinations ##
Little children play with dinosaurs, dress-up clothes, Alphabet letters, and wish lists to Santa Clause.
Once in my twenties, people felt like I was tripping. Actually, I was tripping. I had been so depressed and stressed and felt so overweight that I starved myself for a whole semester. I was imagining things like a little kid does. None of it was real; it was twisted - the images and sounds were distorted, and they were not the full, big picture that God has.

I had so much work, and it all felt so overwhelming. I worked all night in the politics building with so many papers to write and exams to take. It was late at night and early in the morning in the political science building, and I was listening to English and Scottish Christmas music. It felt like a childhood game was going on around me while checking Facebook and other computer programs; my imagination went wild while writing poetry on envy, money, family, farms, and UVA, and I felt like I was entering a game on the computer. I wrote some weird lines of poetry; it's embarassing and awkward to look back on.

After having slept so little, done so much work, and eaten so little, everything felt so heavy while walking back to my dorm room. I even felt like I saw a high school teacher riding his bike outside.
Everything felt "stranger than fiction", as they say, but I could still feel God.
My roommate was there; she was beautiful, strong, smart, and interesting and she was from Hong Kong. But I was not fully sound mentally.
It felt like the dinosaurs were roaring, and I had traveled back in time into the age of the dinosaurs. It felt like a terrorist attack.
I could not move. I felt stuck, frozen, and after starving myself for so long, I rushed to go eat, where I felt the love of the people in the dining hall.

After leaving the dining hall to walk into the cold, brisk, winter air, it felt like I was in the age of the Vietnam War. Everything felt cold, gray-brown-dark-red-green in the depth of winter.
I felt confused. Something felt off. I could not articulate what felt off. I knew God, and a sense of childlike joy and discovery in my heart; but I was fascinated by the distorted sense of reality.

I wrote emails madly to a professor, sounding like a lunatic or a mad woman. I met with him face-to-face, in person. I remember sharing how I felt like I could understand the primitive nature of the Alphabet purely through intuition.

Then I entered into the library and saw my friend. It felt almost like I was walking through a children's book or a video game. The light was shining through the darkness in the library, and the books of college guys sitting at desks reminded me of my dad there in the 1980s. I remember the angel voices, the angel monument, and the beauty of the Chinese students working at their desks. And then I remember going to the church nearby to see people dancing like children.

I then heard voices - like middle school girls laughing, maybe gossiping but probably not, and high school guys bullying me and laughing at me. 
I had felt forgiveness for him, saw the light in him, but the voices became so loud. It was a distorted sense of reality. It was not really him. It was the ghost of him, and the ghost of me. It was the false him, and the false me. I rushed into his fraternity house, saw the light shining through window in the dark while the Christ light was speaking with the "still, small voice" in my heart, his heart, all of our hearts. I acted out some movie characters, like Mary Poppins, who taught children to "find the fun in every job that must be done", and he called the police on me so I could be taken care of in the hospital.

It all felt like a computer game in some way inside the fraternity home and then in the hospital. Interacting with the cops, and handing over credit cards to people like women do when feeling financially dependent on men, can feel freaky especially after working to forgive someone and see the goodness and light in them. My romantic heart came up in self-defense, claiming the rose in my heart that needed to be nourished and watered. I loved all the nurses, and doctors, and people in the hospital, but I felt like I could hear the voices of my family - my cousins, my aunts. All the sounds felt like I was in the North Pole with kitchen sounds, and voice receivers; "what the hell is going on?" I remember questioning in the hospital, but I was tripping and imagining things in the way a little kid imagines Santa Clause and dinosaurs. The false senses were not real. They were distorted sounds and images because the human, mortal mind draws false associations between things.

My dad arrived, and so did my mom. They comforted me. They helped me feel the Christmas light that shines through the darkness and heals the "grinch that steals Christmas." The grinch was trying to steal Christmas. The grinch had been trying to steal Christmas all year. But coming back down to Hooville, from the top of the majestic, blue Appalachian mountains, the grinch realized it had no power, and I could feel the light of the Christ speaking.

There was restoration between the bullying guy and me. There was some healing. There was some light shining through the darkness during the Christmas season. And I opened up to strangers, and felt exposed for thoughts that were not really mine. It was not really me.

At first I felt embarassed when looking back and remembering this all. Then I read some books for children, and realized that it's ok for children to imagine, so I could think of an adult tripping like a child imagining things, and it makes it more light.

I got into trouble, I violated the boundary of the fraternity house that my dad and peer were in, and my brother too. But translating the terroristic, violating images of thought into childlike images of thought sheds light on the situation.

## Thinking Above Political Lines ##
Every individual is God's son or daughter, and his or her thought has the freedom to rest above the political lines and social statuses drawn in the country or the world through loving each individual. Leaning on the divine substance, women can express feminine and masculine qualities, men can express masculine and feminine qualities; buoyantly, women and men can fluidly work in different spheres of the economy and depend wholly on God, the "consciousness of good", not any false beliefs about mankind.

My mom was a traditional Southern mom, but she encouraged me to become a career woman. I became more of a career woman because I felt angry about feeling "too simple" like some people from the rural south do, too dependent on men, and incapable of understanding everything I read in the political economy; I also felt critical of aspects of the domestic economy because of how I heard my mom, and since then, I have felt cut off from the sense of Southern home, even though I feel "home" as the "consciousness of good." I learn to bring my work in the political economy into the domestic economy, recultivate my love of home, and use skills in the home.

My mom always felt like the ideal Southern woman, and I have felt angry sometimes over that; or when I see other women seeming like the ideal Southern woman, I have felt inferior. But I learn to express gratitude for all mankind, and love the consciousness of good more and more.

More broadly, I love home on earth with all of humanity.

## **Listening to country music inspired me to write some poetry on solitude, being single, independence and breaking up.** ##

## The Lone Bird ##
The bird flies in solitude across the land.
It lifts its wings alone so gracefully.
I'd like to be like that lone bird, unafraid to show dignity on the fence, possessed by her quiet strength.
Not heartbroken when he breaks my heart.
Not angry when he ignores my words.
Not startled when he has a new friend.
But relieved that I can fly freely with love and peace in my heart, and still sing my song too.
No song is too simple. No song is too advanced. All of humanity is singing a song with this lone bird on the fence.
My heart soars higher, my eyes look deeper, my vision grows further when he lets go.

## Fighting for Independence ##
Let go of the gun.
let the reign of Truth and Love in.
Fighting for Independence, where there is ground beneath my feet,
trust, love, and joy in the depths of my soul,
goodness that is greater than evil
and a light that embraces everything through all the Earth.

## Our Country ##
Everyone in our country are like stars shining on the American flag
The light can't burn out.
The people are so innocent.
The water flows steadily through the channels, giving us peace and restoration.
Forever in the night, the stars do shine.
Our hearts burn.
Everyone in the country, everyone on the Earth has a light like the star that burns, and shines.
God holds us all amazingly int act, in one grand brotherhood, sisterhood.

## The Union ##
North, South, East, West
We all stand in this union, 
where everything is interconnected, 
rising above the conflict, the chaos, 
finding our common bond, and the bridge to the other side

## The Rose Within ##
There is a rose within everyone's heart.
It must be watered, it must be nourished.
The love is strong, and the light is bright, even at night. It is all one with all of humanity.

## Healing from Abuse, both the Abused and the Abuser ##
There was no reason to be jealous.
You have it all within, sister.
The qualities are there. The latent talent is there.
You may blossom differently or later, but sister, you spring from the same source, and the ideas are there.
So love your brother, and love your sister. Love must go before you, and you are not estranged.
Sometimes the night must be taken back, the fight within must stop, and the time to be receptive must come.
God does amazing work through the pain, and really opens us up to Her living reality.

## Healing from The Tendency to Fight ##
I want to fight back, react, send an email, kick a door, hit, or write a negative comment.
I want to manipulate the situation to meet my wants.
I want to yell out with anger and express rage to deal with the feelings of insecurity and inferiority.
I want to run away, hide, lay in bed all day, or withdraw.
And I have done these things...
...But I learn to pause...
I learn to think things through.
I learn to love more.
I learn to ask better questions.
I learn to apologize.
I learn to forgive.
I learn to see things from a different perspective.
I learn to resurrect.
I learn to exercise self-control.
I learn to write poetry.

## The South ##
What is in the South?
Friendly neighbors, lightness of heart, good food - grits, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, oyster stuffing, and white houses and amazing nurses, and teachers.
Good music - bluegrass, country, the blues, and jazz, and bridges to the West Coast.
Equality for all.
A connection to the land.
A love of home and family.
Freedom from racial, gender, and cultural politics.

## The Country Music and the Rejection ##
Did it heal your relationship to the Country or the country?
It healed my relationship to the Country and the country.
I was already from the South, but negative memories of the South and race that infiltrated my thought were chased away.
I already loved the sound of the trains, but it brought me closer to the nation-wide railways.
I was already aware of the lumber industry, but it brought me one step closer to it.
I already knew Tennessee and bluegrass music, but it brought me one step closer to this light-hearted music as well as the Blues.
I was already from Virginia, but it shed light on West Virginia, nearby, and brought me one step closer to Old Virginia.
I thought I was relating to the South, but it made me aware of the beauty of the West.
I had already been to South America, but it brought me more love for the South Americans.
I had already been to Scotland and Ireland, but it woke up my memories of a love for Scottish and Irish music.
I had already traveled to the West to visit the natives, but it called my attention to the greater whole.
I had already felt denied by Southern culture, but it woke me up to my Southern mom.
I was already aware of the trucks at the Port and on the roads, but it led me to love the truck drivers more.
I had thought Country music was just for White People, but I realized I already listened to country music produced by African Americans.
I denied that the music was for me, and prayed that there was another woman the song was for.
I felt for him, and loved his heart, but felt guilt, rejected, and ignored, and ashamed, and I grew stronger.
I felt ignored, and I wished him well, and encouraged him to move in another direction, and pushed him away.
He broke away, and I trusted he was led to something better. 
When listening more deeply, it reminded me of my high school friend, and woke me up to how he viewed the world in a clearer light.
I fell down hard to the ground, learned some life lessons, and the Black man saved my life with good cheer, good faith, and a good conversation.
I had already felt eternity once, but I felt eternity for the whole country, all the people, and the touch of eternity I felt in my darkest hours.

## Cars on the Roads #
In the red, white, and blue, where there are all sorts of people.
Every one is individual.
There are cool blue and brown buicks, sweet red trucks, sophisticated gray and black CRVs, all driving on the same roads.
Weaving in and out through the cities and the land, we all live in one country under the God in which we trust.
## engineering, math, the distance between cars, everyone is individual, a sea of cars ##

## America ## 
Digging into the depth of the earth, wedded to the earth,
where the soil is thick
and knows her story
and leaves room for all to grow in their own way.

## Healing from Weird Words ##

## Healing from Email Attacks ##

## Opening Up, Anger, Strife ##
Shoving the things down that I should not share
Feeling uncomfortable, embarassed, and over-exposed

## Industry 2.0 ##

## Why Am I Being Tracked? ##

## Same Roads, New View ##
I have driven down these roads before
but I see them, the people, the homes in a new light.
Everything grows richer, deeper, fuller, and more alive.
I see the beauty, not the poverty.

## Looking Deeper, Looking Wider ##
Looking deeper, looking wider, I find my home, and the truth within
I find the place where everyone, everything is interconnected
where bad memories are replaced, new pictures captured

## Letting It Go and Moving On ##
When he let me go, I got in the car.
I drove through Bristol, Nashville, Memphis, and across the Arkansas Bridge to West Memphis.
Then I drove through Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and the Rust Belt, across another bridge over the Ohio River.
I met some new friends, stayed in some hotels, heard some new stories, read some new books, saw new artwork,
and traveled back down West Virginia Country Roads, where everything felt like home in a new way.
Driving by the train tracks, feeling the freshness of the Rivers, and seeing the Americans doing their work,
America felt new, yet the same.
I remembered my family, and the deep, deep roots that run through the ground.
I saw why people want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, but it has always been great and will always be great.

## Letting It Go ##
I never wanted to let him, her go 
He/she was so close to home
I had prayed for so long
I prayed for the wrong thing
I learned to pray to lover ha and him
And I let it go

In finding the beauty all around
I let it go
I entered a new day and opened my ehart again
No one can steal my heart

## It Starts At the Port ##
It starts at the port.
Every morning, the orange, green, white, and blue trucks drive from the shipyard to the streets.
The trucks drive harmoniously down Hampton Roads like the birds do when they fly.
Where do they go? From the driveways in the port city to the shipyard to the country roads.
There's a beautiful chain of freight traveling through the port cities and then through the country.

## From Port to Port ##
From port to port
The sun shines in every place
From different angles
We all look to the same sun
From different corners of the Earth
From different places in the Universe

## Roots ##
You can claim what you were born to be.
Your roots may have dried out, but your roots run deeply into the groun.
Dig within deeply, remove the weeds, and discover the glory.
The glory, the beauty, the soul of Soul is there.

## Home and Music ##
Home is where it all begins.
There's a place for music and you all in my heart forever.
Childlike memories of light, dancing, and merriment last forever.
No hurt can reach the child within, we all express this sweet, childlike innocence.

## The Sound of Silence ##
The sound of silence is so grand, so great, so beautiful.
In the silence, I can hear the greatest music, the greatest song of all.
In the silence, I feel the leaves, the rain, the sun, the breeze, the road, the trucks, the goodness of all the people on both side of politics.
I made myself vulnerable, started opening up, felt guilt and then shame, and then embarassment, then violent, and then angry.
I opened up in the wrong way.
There was silence, no response, feelings of inferiority. I fell, and stooped so low in violence.
I rose up higher with a bounce in my step, a love for someone else, and a resilient sense of being.
I tried to apologize, I saw more deeply, learned grander lessons, and felt the true sound of silence in my own heart rather than the sound of silence coming from someone not accepting of me reaching out.
Every heart is so beautiful, and I know this true sound of silence is within everyone's heart, but the false beliefs, the dark clouds cover the true sound of silence.

## Children's Play ##
Playing on the keys without words
I discover a joy and a light in the sound that reminds me of little kids on a playground
No words are needed because the color and the youthfulness are in the sound bouncing with joy

## The Agitation in America ##
When the riots fell down on the White house, the breakdowns happened at the Confederate Monuments, and the sense of loss and of lack stirred up agitation,
the American dream felt out of reach to people.
The American dream is not lost.
America, founded on a rock, will always represent freedom to humanity.
Have no fear, American people, we are all God's sons and daughters, and there's a new day under the Sun.
What's great about America remains great.
What needs to be known about America will be known.
The dross of the country will be removed, and the gold of the country will be refined and come to the surface.
There's newness for the country coming to life.
There's grace, equity, equality, and justice for today.
The governors represent the people, all the people.
Nothing is lost, nothing about America's roots are being displaced.
Everyone in the country belongs - all races, all creeds, all cultures, all religions.
America, a melting pot.
We were and can all be immigrants made new, we were and can all be explorers of the new earth, we were and can all be settlers finding our place to rest and be at peace, we were and can all be freedom-finders, no matter our background.
Americans, tied to the land, has a new day in the Sun.
The land belongs to everyone.
America is not at the center, but represents freedom-finding, for all ethnic backgrounds and races.

## Constant Evolution ##
There is a constant story of being, evolution of thought, revolution of light, rebirthing of man, and renewal of color.

## **A Poem on Black Lives** ##
## Seeing Black Lives ##
They help the police force as police officers.
They play music.
They read in church.
They create amazing art.
They help the homeless community.
They take care of little kids and love them, and hug them.
They help people feel better after feeling fallen, or rejected.
They are great sorority formal partners.
They create art and music.
They dance in the street.
They love their work.
They support their kids. 
They have healthy, beautiful homes.
They love Allah, the same God that Christians worship.
They also love God, and they have great faith through adversity.

## **A Poem on Social Media** ##
## Social Media Usage ##
Why look her, or him up one more time? 
Lurking on social media; why lurk behind the scenes again?
I put a stop to the lurking, and control my usage.

The images are beautiful; I am receiving Christmas Cards all years.
It's a place to express love, and appreciation, and meet people from a distance.
It's a place to see the beauty and childlike grace and innocence expressed in everyone.
People express joy in amazing ways and share that with everyone online.

But why open up so much to strangers from a distance?
Use wisdom, carefulness, and caution. Don't be someone from the outside looking in through the window you should not look through.

Be someone on the inside, being safe, being a friend to those you know.
Share photos like a Christmas Card, but limit the usage to those you know.

## What is My Motive? ##
To love someone new today.
To move beyond my comfort zone.
To include all of humanity in prayer.
To understand someone who needs help.
To express patience in my thought.
To see from a different angle.
To shift a habit.
To demonstrate order and cleanliness.

## Race - Why Do We Talk about Race? Why Do We Not Talk About Race? ##
What is race? A group or category of people. There are individuals within the group or the category. People tend to rank individuals within the group or the category. Race is not the only way to rank or group.
Why do I talk about race? To understand how someone perceives the world, to understand someone's cultural background, to appreciate the beauty of race, to understand someone in a different group.
Why do I not talk about race? To respect boundaries, to talk about more elevated ideas above the physique.

## The American Chain [Written in 2010] ##
As a child, I gerw up singing 'I am proud to be an American' like many of my peers. I never knew what it meant to be an American though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race. As Crevecoeur explains Americans, "we have no princes for hom we toil, starve, and bleed...Here man is free as he ought to be, nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are'. The American country gives a sense of opportunity to every unique individual. The American people volunteer their time to help other American people. If these characteristics of America are not fully true, they are a common goal for what our country will become; we continue to work towards these goals constantly. Lazarus illustrates that America welcomes even the "tired", the "poor", and the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" (11-12, 329).

A little over a year ago, in February 2008, I was at the Barack Obama rally where 18,000 people attended. When Obama began his speech the responses from everyone in the audience gave a feel of community support. Everyone was there for a common rreason; to support Obama, to support the Democrats, and most of all to support the United States of America. I felt love from each person standing near me. Everyone stood in a tight place, for over two hours, but I heard no complaints; everyone worked together to make the rally successful.

I had a similar experience in October 2008 when I went to another Barack Obama rally at the Tides' Stadium one week before the election. This event strengthened my love of being present in a community of Americans. Everyone had to behave and work together in the thirty degree weather to make the rally successful. Once again, each person I saw expressed friendliness and happiness. People stood in line patiently for hours before entering the stadium. Friends and neighbors helped each other when rushing through security. Volunteers gave their time to guide people to open seats.

Finally, in January 2009, on the Inaugaration Day, although I was not there, I watched the big event on television. As I watched the millions of people there, I could feel the preesnce of a true society. That day was truly a day full of nonpartisanship and support for America from everyone. Everyone supported Barack Obama on this day, a day of uniting America together. I not only truly felt like an American on that special day, but I also loved being an American. I wanted to make a difference for my country.

Throughout Obama's campaign and these three events, because I have grown love my country and understand the meaning of America, I have challenged myself to give back to this society. I decided to go to Monroe Elementary on Tuesday and Thrusday afternoons when I did not have activities after school. I help children who do not have the same privileges in their households with their homework through the "Homework Help" program. I do this with the Park Place Childlife Center. The children may not be able to read as well, or make as good grades as other children their age, but they all have such big hearts and love for people in general. The children all suppport each other and push each other to do their homework. The relationships between the students and my relationships to the students represent the American culture.

Because of the three events during Barack Obama's campaign and inauguration, I have realized the good of the American people, and I have learned the importance of giving back to my country. I can now declare that I understand the meaning of America. Through storm or shine, our country can fight its challenges with the help of each individual. Each individual is like a link in the chain. Each individual can also be represented as a bead in Dillard's notion where "each bead is transparent and each has a world, or the same world, light and alive and apparent inside the drop" (577). Each individual, despite his class, race, or gender matters. Each individual can contribute something to our society. Each individual ahs the opportunity to grow if he learns to work hard. If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

## **I am not a naturally verbal thinker. I am more naturally a visual thinker, and it has taken me a long time in life to learn how to express my feelings in a world where expressing feelings, or opening up is not ok. I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering. Earlier in 2020, and before 2020, I was sending aggressive emails, but my sister realized that some of my attacks had a poetic sound underlying them. Some people don't feel like expressing feelings is ok, and that feelings must be worked out independently; but feelings must be expressed, others express feelings through music, and poetry is a good tool for expressing feelings verbally. I write two poems each day.** ##

When I don't know how to arise another day out of bed, I find health from God within.
This source within is powerful.
One small intuition can grow and grow into potency.
One small seed can be the muscle for a long, entire life.
One choice to think differently can become the sinew for many more thoughts and actions to come.
