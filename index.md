Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
