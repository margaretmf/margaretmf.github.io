## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site. 

<img class="profile-picture" src="mefour.jpg">

## Short Biography ##
I am **Margaret Furr**, a graduate of the University of Virginia. Currently, I am working as a **Data Analyst** with **[Richmond National](https://www.richmondnational.com/)**, an excess and surplus insurance business. I am excited to repivot into data analytics and technology after working as a **Literacy Tutor** with **[The Literacy Lab](https://theliteracylab.org/)**, as part of a second **AmeriCorps service year**, because The Literacy Lab's program is discontinuing. While I am not tutoring, I have worked as a **Substitute Teacher Assistant** with **[Horizons Hampton Roads](https://www.horizonshamptonroads.org)** and as a **Glee Club and Cabin Counselor** with **[Camp Nakanawa](https://campnakanawa.org/)**. Previously, I worked as a **Data Analyst** with **[EVERFI](https://everfi.com/)**, an educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. I then worked as a **Freelance Researcher** for **the social sector**.

I have enjoyed working as a **pro bono strategic alignment consultant** for **[The Welders](https://www.thewelders.org/)**, **[Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org)**, and **[Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org)** through **[Compass](http://compassprobono.org)** to revitalize the DC community, and I have worked as a **proposal reviewer**, **project manager**, **data ambassador** and **data analyst** with **[DataKind](http://www.datakind.org)**. It has been fun to interview people experiencing homelessness with **[Design for the Homeless](https://www.designforthehomeless.org/)**.

The values that Thomas Jefferson and other founders shared in the Declaration of Independence and the active pursuit of Life, Liberty, and Happiness inspire me. 

Every day I seek to learn something new to stay alive. It's amazing how all humanity works together for good in small ways and big ways. I am grateful to "push the boundary of what's possible', hopefully 'in the name of the greater good" (Thomas Jefferson). It's great to cultivate latent talents and play around like little kids and amateurs, and I seek to do work scientifically, applying best practices.

I am exploring how to sketch and how to use visual arts to share history and culture, and also use visual sketching to support the field of engineering.

I love working on photography of light in the darkness, American flags, leaves, windows, doors, every day objects in nature, and homes. I also love developing an understanding of signs and symbols from different languages, and I am working on a series of sketches of symbols.

With a love for writing and reading, I have been continuing the work on the American Credo project that students started in 11th grade at Norfolk Academy. Continuing the American Credo project consists of writing creatively, examining beliefs, understanding the country, and creating art. My true passion is writing about engineering, STEAM, and educational content, and I dream of writing at least one book on how people with liberal arts degrees work in the real world or entrepreneurship. I love children's books and how people turn them into films. My other true passion is connecting to people through authentic conversations and eye-to-eye level meetings. I am working to understand all the government leaders by reading about them, and I am interested in how poetry supports coding and coding supports poetry. Finally, I am researching themes in books like oneness, unity, faith in politics, women's role in elections, the story of America, republican-democratic party dynamics, and what the American States are. I also love exploring how people create music.

Little children are healing, organizing things gives me life, and expressing good cheer through all things is what gives me life.

I love world cultures.

Currently, I am studying the Spanish version of the Bible. I am revitalizing an appreciation for the beautiful language. I am listening to music and the radio in Spanish every day.

I believe that the stories that families share about ancestors are the most spiritual elements of who people are. I believe that details matter. I believe in respecting the secrets that people share. 

It is interesting how movements start from the ground-up. I am interested in the world cultures, narratives, and archetypes around engineering as well as STEAM education. 

Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is "Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."
