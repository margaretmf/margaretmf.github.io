## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

## Short Biography, **La Biografía** ##
I am **Margaret Furr**, a graduate of the University of Virginia. My dream job is a **Design Researcher** role, and I would love to learn more about workplace architecture, the circular economy, and financial principles. As a classically educated historian, I care most about going back to the primary origin of ideas.

**Me llamo Margarita, y estoy una graduada de la Universidad de Virginia. Mi sueño de trabajo es un rol como una investigadora de diseña, y quiero aprender mas sobre los edificios de oficinas, la economía circular, los principios financieros. Como una historiadora educada, tengo cuidado a mayoría de regresando al origen primario de las ideas.**

The values that Thomas Jefferson and other founders shared in the Declaration of Independence and the active pursuit of Life, Liberty, and Happiness inspire me. 

**Los valores que Thomas Jefferson y otros descrubridores compartieron en la Declaración de Independiencia y la búsqueda de La Vida, La Libertad, y La Felicidad me inspiran.**

Every day I seek to learn something new to stay alive. It's amazing how all humanity works together for good in small ways and big ways. I am grateful to **push the boundary of what's possible**, hopefully **in the name of the greater good** (Thomas Jefferson). It's great to cultivate latent talents and play around like little kids and amateurs, and I seek to do work scientifically, applying best practices.

**Todos los días, busco aprender alguna cosa nueva para vivir. Es asombrosa que toda de la humanidad trabaja juntos para bien en caminos pequeños y caminos grandes. Tengo gratitude para *la emprendedora de los límites de que posible*, con esperanza que es *en el nombre de la mayor bien* (Thomas Jefferson). Es excelente cultivar talentos latentes y jugar como niñas pequeñas, y busco trabajar científicamente, aplicando mejores prácticas.**

I am exploring how to sketch and how to use visual arts to share history and culture, and also use visual sketching to support the field of engineering.

**Explorando que dibujar y que usar las artes visuales para expresar historia y cultura. Tambien, explorando que usar dibujando para apoyar el campo de Ingenieria.**

I love working on photography of light in the darkness, American flags, leaves, windows, doors, every day objects in nature, and homes. Currently, I am researching themes in books like oneness, unity, faith in politics, women's role in elections, the story of America, black lives' roles, republican-democratic party dynamics, and what the American States are. I also love exploring how people create music.

**Me amo trabajando en fotografia de la luz en la oscuridad, la bandera de los Estados Unidos, las hojas, las ventanas, las puertas, los objetos cotidianos en la naturaleza, y las cosas. En este momento, investigando los temas en los libros como la Unidad, la unión, la fe en las ciencias políticas, papel de la mujer en las elecciones, la historida de America, las vidas de los afroamericanos, la dinámica republicano-democrática del partido, y qué son los Estados americanos. Me amo explorando cómo la gente crea música.**

With a love for writing, I have been continuing the work on the American Credo project that students started in 11th grade at Norfolk Academy. Continuing the American Credo project consists of writing poetry, creative writing, examining beliefs, understanding the country, and creating art. My true passion is writing about engineering, STEAM, and educational content, and I love children's books and how people turn them into films. My other true passion is connecting to people through authentic conversations and eye-to-eye level meetings. I am working to understand all the government leaders by reading about them, and I am interested in how poetry supports coding and coding supports poetry.

**Mi pasión verdadera es la escritura sobe la Ingenieria, STEAM, y contenido pedagógico.**

Little children are healing, organizing things gives me life, and expressing good cheer in the Post Office, in the Fed Ex Building, and on the Construction Streets keeps people vivacious, humble, and singing inside.

**Niños pequeños y niñas son cicatrización, organizando es mi pasión, y expresando buen animo en la Oficina Correo, en el edificio de Federal Rápida, y en las calles construcciónes mantiene la gente vivaz, humilde, y cantando por dentro.** 

I love world cultures, includng African, Arab, Chinese, Spanish, and Native cultures. 

**Me amo muchas de las culturas del mundo, incluyendo Africano, Árabes, Chino, Español, y Nativa.**

Currently, I am studying the Spanish version of the Bible. I am revitalizing an appreciation for the beautiful language. I am listening to music and the radio in Spanish every day.

**Actualmente, estudiando la versión de La Biblia en Español. Estoy revitalizando una apreciación por el idioma muy bonito. Escuchando a la música y la radio en Español todos de los días.**

I believe that the stories that families share about ancestors are the most spiritual elements of who people are. I believe that details matter. I believe in respecting the secrets that people share. The way people capture stories is important.

It is interesting how movements start from the ground-up. I am interested in the world cultures, narratives, and archetypes around engineering as well as STEAM education. The books for children by Jean Craighead George capture creatively the historic culture around engineering and nature.

**Creo que los cuentos que familias contan sobre sus antepasados son los elementos más espirituales de quien la gente están. Creo que los detalles importan. Es importantae respitar los misterios que la gente comparte. Como la gente captura los cuentos es valiosa.**

**Estoy interesada en como los movimientos comienzan desde el principio. Estoy interesada en las culturas, las narrativas, y los arquetipos sobre la ingeniería así como STEAM educación. Los libros para las niñas por Jean Craighead George capturan creativamente la cultura histórica alrededor la ingeniería y la naturaleza.**

Finally, as a student at the University of Virginia and the University of Glasgow, I used to row. I used to wake up by 5am and drove team members to practice in Charlottesville. I'd love to get back into shape and row with a team. Rowing on a river is the best thing to appreciate being a team member, to commit to goals, to express diligence, intelligence, a sense of unity and oneness, and strength, and to love nature - the water, the trees, the birds.

**Finalmente, como un estudiante de las Universidad de Virginia y la Universidad de Glasgow, remé. Desperté antes de ante a las 5 am y condujo miembros del equipo para practicar en Charlottesville, Virginia y en Glasgow, Scotland. Me encantaría volver a estar en forma y remar con un equip. Remando en a río es la cosa mejor para agradecer ser una miembra de un equipo, cometer a metas, expresar diligencia, intelligencia, un sentido de unidad, y fuerza, and amar naturaleza - la agua, los árboles, y los aves.**

## Longer Work Biography ##
As a continuous, lifelong learner, I am developing expertise in **photography**, **sketching**, **writing**, **ethnographic interviewing**, **computer programming**, **languages - Español, English, and interested in Native and Chinese characters and symbols, and Sanskrit**. and **understanding the Bible spiritually**. I also love learning about **requirements specification for product development**, **visual arts, drawing, and painting**, **music**, and **math, science, English, and arts education**. I love helping people as well as living spontaneously and orderly.

Most recently, I have been learning about antiracism and working on photography of light in the darkness and continuing the work to "Take Back the Night."

I am exploring how to paint the light in the darkness series, and looking to the light in the house and on the streets led me to explore using visual arts to understand electrical and civil engineering of homes and cities. I also explore sketching construction sites, geometric shapes, and civil engineering concepts.

To reconcile being a career woman and a woman who loves home, I have started to think about all the activities inside and outside the home from an engineering and visual arts perspective.

I love developing an understanding of signs and symbols from different languages, and I am working on a series of sketches of symbols.

I have also driven through 12 states (Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina), taken photos of American flags, and explored rivers, trains, highways, bridges, and civil infrastructure in our country. I nurture a love of maps, rivers, and the opportunity to learn our country by experience. Kinesthetic learning, and experiential learning helps to understand visually and experientially the country. Listening to music and reading books, and meeting people in hotels also helps people understand what is going on. While learning about farmland and country in America, as well as in Ireland and Scotland back in 2013, I also have an interest in farmland, country, logistics, and supply chain engineering in all countries on Earth.

To learn to articulate feelings and thoughts, I have started writing poetry.

Before this work, I worked as a **Data Analyst** with **EVERFI**, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. EVERFI is really good at expanding people's cultural awareness and sense of compassion, and bringing people to first-hand experiences of culture in places.

I have enjoyed working as a **pro bono strategic alignment consultant** for [The Welders](https://www.thewelders.org/), [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org), and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org) to revitalize the DC community, and I have worked as a **proposal reviewer**, **project manager**, **data ambassador** and **data analyst** with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org). It has been fund to interview people experiencing homeless with [Design for the Homeless](https://www.designforthehomeless.org/).

Outside of work, one can find me **reading**, **jogging**, **playing music**, **swimming**, **following world affairs**, **managing Instagram and Twitter accounts**, **dancing**, and **committing to peacemaking**. I am most excited about communities, communication, frameworks, and the balance of art and science.

Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
