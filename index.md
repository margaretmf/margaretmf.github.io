## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I am **Margaret Furr**, and I am developing expertise in **writing**, **ethnographic interviewing**, **photography**, and **understanding the Bible spiritually**. I also love learning about **requirements specification for product development**, **visual arts, drawing, and painting**, and **math, science, English, and arts education**. I love helping people as well as living spontaneously and orderly.

It has been fund to interview people experiencing homeless with [Design for the Homeless](https://www.designforthehomeless.org/).

Outside of work, one can find me **reading**, **jogging**, **swimming**, **following world affairs**, **managing Instagram and Twitter accounts**, **dancing**, and **committing to peacemaking**. I am most excited about communities, communication, frameworks, and the balance of art and science.

Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
