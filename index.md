## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I am **Margaret Furr**, and I am a graduate of the University of Virginia. I love the values that Thomas Jefferson and other founders shared in the Declaration of Independence and the active pursuit of Life, Liberty, and Happiness. I seek to learn something new every day to stay alive. I love how all humanity works together for good in small ways and big ways. I am grateful to "push the boundary of what's possible - always in the name of the greater good."

and I am developing expertise in **photography**, **sketching**, **writing**, **ethnographic interviewing**, **computer programming**, and **understanding the Bible spiritually**. I also love learning about **requirements specification for product development**, **visual arts, drawing, and painting**, **music**, and **math, science, English, and arts education**. I love helping people as well as living spontaneously and orderly.

Most recently, I have been learning about antiracism and working on photography of light in the darkness and continuing the work to "Take Back the Night."

I am exploring how to paint the light in the darkness series, and looking to the light in the house and on the streets led me to explore using visual arts to understand electrical and civil engineering of homes and cities.

To reconcile being a career woman and a woman who loves home, I have started to think about all the activities inside and outside the home from an engineering and visual arts perspective.

I have also driven through 10 states (Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia), taken photos of American flags, and explored rivers, trains, highways, bridges, and civil infrastructure in our country. I nurture a love of maps, rivers, and the opportunity to learn our country by experience. Kinesthetic learning, and experiential learning helps to understand visually and experientially the country. Listening to music and reading books, and meeting people in hotels also helps people understand what is going on. While learning about farmland and country in America, as well as in Ireland and Scotland back in 2013, I also have an interest in farmland, country, logistics, and supply chain engineering in all countries on Earth.

To learn to articulate feelings and thoughts, I have started writing poetry.

Before this work, I worked as a **Data Analyst** with **EVERFI**, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships.

It has been fund to interview people experiencing homeless with [Design for the Homeless](https://www.designforthehomeless.org/).

Outside of work, one can find me **reading**, **jogging**, **playing music**, **swimming**, **following world affairs**, **managing Instagram and Twitter accounts**, **dancing**, and **committing to peacemaking**. I am most excited about communities, communication, frameworks, and the balance of art and science.

Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
