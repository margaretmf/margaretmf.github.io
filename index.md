## Hello!

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">


I'm Margaret Furr, and I'm an intellectually curious problem solver. I am developing expertise in data analysis and systems thinking. I also have experience in strategic consulting. With an interest in social impact, technological change, patterns in data, data structures, and international cultures, I'm a curious and versatile professional who loves to draw from multiple disciplines to understand the world and solve problems.

Currently, I'm working as a Data Analyst with EVERFI, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. I have worked as a pro bono strategic alignment consultant for [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org) and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org), and I have worked as a Data Ambassador and Data Analyst with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org). 

During my free time, one can find me running, reading, dancing, and preparing for the future in the 21st century. A sentence that inspires me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is "Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."
