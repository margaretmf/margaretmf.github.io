## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

**About Me:** I am an **intellectually curious problem solver**, developing expertise in **data analysis**, **project planning**, **requirements speficiation**, **systems thinking** and **goal setting and visioning**. I'm a versatile **technical product professional** who loves to draw from multiple disciplines to understand the world and solve problems. My interests are listed below.

**Current Work:** Currently, I'm working as a **Data Analyst** with **EVERFI**, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. I have worked as a **pro bono strategic alignment consultant** for [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org) and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org) around a revitalizing DC community, and I have worked as a **Project Manager**, **Data Ambassador** and **Data Analyst** with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org). 

**Work for Fun:** During my free time, one can find me **running**, **reading**, **photographing**, **dancing**, **preparing for the future in the 21st century**, **practicing spiritual healing**, and **appreciating broader views around the power (or lack of power) in churches and church divides across the world and its languages**. A new co-working, collective consciousness space that I love is **[The Assemblage](https://www.theassemblage.com/)**, and words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
