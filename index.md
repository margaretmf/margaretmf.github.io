## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I am **Margaret Furr**, and I am developing expertise in **data-driven narratives**, **data analysis and impact measurement**, 
**systems practice and systems thinking**, **project planning**, **requirements specificiation**, and **looking at events and problems creatively from multiple perspectives**.

I am a versatile and multidimensional **technical product professional** within the **social innovation workspace** that also aspires to **write narratives** across a lifetime.

I love to draw from **multiple disciplines and angles** to understand the world and solve problems.  

Currently, I, **Margaret Furr**, work as a **Data Analyst** with **EVERFI**, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. 

I have enjoyed working as a **pro bono strategic alignment consultant** for [The Welders](https://www.thewelders.org/), [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org), and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org) to revitalize the DC community, and I have worked as a **proposal reviewer**, **project manager**, **data ambassador** and **data analyst** with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org). 

Outside of work, one can find me **running**, **reading**, **following world affairs**, **understanding 21st century trends**, **taking photos**, **dancing**, **practicing spiritual healing**, and **[appreciating broader views around the power (or lack of power) in churches and church divides across the world and its languages](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/what-should-america-do-its-empty-church-buildings/576592/?utm_source=twb)**. 

A new co-working, collective consciousness space that I love is **[The Assemblage](https://www.theassemblage.com/)**, and words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
