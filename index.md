## Hello! Welcome to Margaret Furr's site.

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

## Short Biography ##
I am **Margaret Furr**, and I am a graduate of the University of Virginia. 

I love the values that Thomas Jefferson and other founders shared in the Declaration of Independence and the active pursuit of Life, Liberty, and Happiness. 

I seek to learn something new every day to stay alive. I love how all humanity works together for good in small ways and big ways. I am grateful to "push the boundary of what's possible", hopefully "in the name of the greater good." I also love to cultivate latent talents and play around like little kids and amateurs.

I have done and said dumb things, retaliated, and shifted from being a rule-follower to someone who expresses anger; but I have begun to turn to poetry to process thoughts and feelings more artistically. I am also exploring how to sketch.

I love little children, organizing things, and expressing good cheer in the Post Office and the Fed Ex Building.


## Work Environment ##
In previous work, I have worked with various types of supervisors.

**What I LOVE about supervisors:**
* Their ability to give candid feedback, and specific requirements, rather than make me guess about what is needed
* Their ability to seek my inputs, and thoughtfully incorporate the inputs
* Their ability to express compassion, empathize, sympathize, and listen to the feelings of people
* Their ability to support cross-departmental work
* Their ability to encourage people to go outside their comfort zone
* Their ability to structure projects and time well
* Their ability to facilitate team work
* Their ability to mentor
* Their ability to work with other teams effectively

**What I HATE about supervisors:**
* Their vague directions and guidance
* Their mispronouncing names
* Their lack of clarity around job descriptions and team goals
* Their disrespect of someone doing work that is more directly related to the work of another team
* Their complaining about how a business overall does work

**I have done some of these things myself, but I have summarized what I appreciate and don't appreciate about supervisors.**

**How Do I Improve Myself?**
* Daily, I work to express gratitude for people and appreciate the latent talents I see in people.
* Daily, I work to listen to the feedback I receive from people.
* Daily, I work to know how I can better work with people.
* Daily, I work to know how I can respect the boundaries of others.

* Daily, I work to move outside of my comfort zone in some way.
* Daily, I work to commit to people who I already know.
* Daily, I work to appreciate and expand upon the work already done in the past.
* Daily, I work to give credit to people where credit is already due.
* Daily, I work to let go of the past.
* Daily, I work to love someone who I haven't fully loved better.
* Daily, I work to give up any vain or personal ambition.
* Daily, I work to listen to the needs of others.
* Daily, I work to appreciate how Christian Science inspires my work, all Christian faiths, other religions, and the work done in the medical world.
* Daily, I work to appreciate my family.


## Longer Work Biography ##
I am developing expertise in **photography**, **sketching**, **writing**, **ethnographic interviewing**, **computer programming**, and **understanding the Bible spiritually**. I also love learning about **requirements specification for product development**, **visual arts, drawing, and painting**, **music**, and **math, science, English, and arts education**. I love helping people as well as living spontaneously and orderly.

Most recently, I have been learning about antiracism and working on photography of light in the darkness and continuing the work to "Take Back the Night."

I am exploring how to paint the light in the darkness series, and looking to the light in the house and on the streets led me to explore using visual arts to understand electrical and civil engineering of homes and cities.

To reconcile being a career woman and a woman who loves home, I have started to think about all the activities inside and outside the home from an engineering and visual arts perspective.

I have also driven through 10 states (Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia), taken photos of American flags, and explored rivers, trains, highways, bridges, and civil infrastructure in our country. I nurture a love of maps, rivers, and the opportunity to learn our country by experience. Kinesthetic learning, and experiential learning helps to understand visually and experientially the country. Listening to music and reading books, and meeting people in hotels also helps people understand what is going on. While learning about farmland and country in America, as well as in Ireland and Scotland back in 2013, I also have an interest in farmland, country, logistics, and supply chain engineering in all countries on Earth.

To learn to articulate feelings and thoughts, I have started writing poetry.

Outside of work, one can find me **reading**, **jogging**, **playing music**, **swimming**, **following world affairs**, **managing Instagram and Twitter accounts**, **dancing**, and **committing to peacemaking**. I am most excited about communities, communication, frameworks, and the balance of art and science.

Words that inspire me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is **"Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."**
