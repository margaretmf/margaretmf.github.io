# Creative Writing - Structured Poetry #
## Quarto Publishing Group Leaders, Rage Kindelsperger (Publisher), Laura Dew (Creative Director), and Cara Donaldson (Managing Editor) wrote the following about poetry: ##

'You're a poet, and you know it.
Long before we had cities of stone or the technology to write, our ancestors were expressing their wants, needs, and personalities through singing and reciting poetry. Poetry was a record of history, an art form for every age, and a weapon capable of swaying any battle. It was the simplest form of communication for centuries.

Connecting you to the legacy of poetry, this journal helps you dive into writing poems no matter your level of experience. Poems can be anything born of words - descriptions of random thoughts, simple stories, or fleeting feelings. 

In this journal, you will start your writing exercise by selecting a topic that triggers an idea. Then, review the word associations and think about how each relates to the topic or any connected experiences you've ahd in your own life. Jot down whatever comes to mind in the space provided; disjointed thoughts and phrase or internal dialogue are all encouraged, these need not be complete sentences. Now, you're ready to put it all together in a lyrical masterpiece of your own. There are now wrong answers; each poem is unique and personal to the writer.' 

## **I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering. Earlier in 2020, and before 2020, I was sending aggressive emails, but my sister realized that some of my attacks had a poetic sound underlying them. Some people don't feel like expressing feelings is ok, and that feelings must be worked out independently; but feelings must be expressed, others express feelings through music, and poetry is a good tool for expressing feelings verbally. I write two poems each day.** ##


## Clouds ##
The clouds. 
They sit like a blanket covering the sky, and looking like puff, they sit in the sky for a divinely childlike adventure.
The clouds.
They hold the water and the mist.
When there is a lot of water, they become thunderheads.
The clouds.
They are so beautiful in the sky.
People imagine different things about them and how they support our ecosystem.

<br>

**Word Associations:** puff, mist, billow, blanket, swarm, thunderhead, nebulous, cumulous

## A Sunny Day ##
A sunny day is like God smiling through the day.
God's light shines through our land and our hearts.
Each man, each individual can see the sun radiating from a slightly different perspective.
All of mankind can bask in the light of God, this sun that shines through the day in brilliant ways.
We can all choose to appreciate the summery sense of life. 

<br>

**Word Associations:** luminous, summery, shining, clarion, radiant, brilliant, bask, haze

## Anger ##
The feelings of guilt and shame turn to anger. 
My heart rages inside.
I cannot control it.
I feel vexed.
That's all I feel.
I feel like I am inferior to others and delayed, and the sense of being caged in makes me feel frustrated, and thwarted.
The darkness inside - I cannot hide it for much longer.
The darkness is lurking, and I can't shove it down.
'I should feel ashamed of myself and embarassed' is all I hear people voice.
The shame and embarassment turn to anger and rage. 
There is enmity towards what God is doing and what I want.
I am committing malice when giving into the raging heart.
Nothing is stronger and more dangerous than this indignation and sense of injustice.
Expressing gratitude for every ounce of good turns around the monstrous storm.

<br>

**Word Associations:** acrimony, ire, enmity, indignation, vexation, choler, rage, malice

## Sadness ##
It's a huge nightmare, a shock to the whole bodily system.
Heartache, grief, woe, bleekness, and wanting to yell out of sadness.
Crying but choosing to love beyond the grief, the tears.
Everything feels broken and despondent, but everything is still in tact, and there is still so much goodness and mercy.
Sadness cannot overtake me.
Only Love overcomes.
There's always more beauty, and good cheer to wake up to.

<br>

**Word Associations:** heartache, bleakness, dysphoria, woe, grief, despondent, sorrow, suffering

## Joy ##
Joy comes from opening a window to the sunlight.
I choose to be cheerful and appreciate a new day.
I live with glee and delight because there's fresh space to shut out the noise.
Elation comes when dancing and having a good time.

<br>

**Word Associations:** glee, rapture, ecstasy, bliss, cheer, contentment, delight, elation


## The Past ##
The past is done. It's gone. It's a distant dream, a memory fading away so that the future of new mercies can unfold.
Let bygones teach us the lessons while holding on to remembrances of the good.
Nothing is born of ruminating about what happened long ago or regretting past actions.
The present is here to be made new.
The cycle of light continues through history forever.

<br>

**Word Associations:** memory, distant, history, remembrance, antiquity, memoir, bygone, long ago

## Love ##
Love blooms like a red rose within one's heart that is shared with others with no regret.
Love is beyond emotion.
Love is the flame within that chooses to see the beauty and good cheer belonging to God.
Love is the fondness shared between two people holding hands, hugging, smiling, laughing, forgiving, seeing past the lies.
Love is the purest form of affection, like a glass filled with water overflowing for everyone around.
Yearning for the love for all mankind and the smiles on all of mankind's fate is what we all seek.

<br>

**Word Associations:** adoration, affection, yearning, flame, emotion, ardor, fondness, rapture

## The Sun ##
The Sun is always there.
Never will there be a day when mankind questions whether the sun is there.
Sometimes the clouds obstruct the light shining from the sun in its full effulgence, radiance.
Always the sun is golden, bringing its heart to the people, humanity.
All of our hearts, and minds, like the sun can come to full effulgence, beyond the shadow of human existence and reign and every day.

<br>

**Word Associations:** golden, effulgence, solstice, radiance, heat, dappled, shadow, zenith

## Letter to Oneself ##
Sweet Margaret,
Do not feel self-conscious all the time; you look beautiful, you make good grades, and you express kindness to everyone when you smile and reach out. Rather than worry about what people think of you, either say hello or give a smile to people instead.

I know you often feel unhappy because of how some of your friends have treated you. Stop dwelling on this though; reach out and meet new friends. Have confidence that by expressing happiness, your right friends will come at the right time.

I know how much kindness and love you have in your heart, so quit hiding behind your shell. Although you still often struggle with insecurity, I find you being more joyful when you radiate friendliness. After receiving the award of *Silver Letter Girl* at camp this past summer, you have recognized the importance of spreading smiles, compliments, and hellos, and you have learned to feel more confident with yourself.

I realize that you do not feel as if you are "good" at any of your activities. Who really cares about your grade on your history test, your one hundred freestyle time, or the number of scenes in which you are? In the end, these things have no importance; your happiness, will be forever necessary. Anyway, in reality, you do so much better than you think you do, and you give so much effort into everything. Your playing *100 years* on the piano in ninth grade at the recital despite not believing in your capability of learning the last two pages in time reflects this.

You are a beautiful teenage girl; you thus need to stop having negative thoughts about your body and looks because it will only have a negative impact. Knowing that you reflect God's perfect image, you will feel more confident about your looks, your intelligence, and your musical or athletic strengths.

To stop criticizing yourself, you must believe in your strengths and know your great value in the world. Share your love with everyone. Live each day full of greetings, smiles, laughter, and joy.

Much love,
Margaret

3 Voices: Your mentor told you the lesson taught, the historian with the facts. your tender, heartfelt, poetic response to what you learned

# Creative Writing - Independent Writing #
## Singer-Songwriting ##
Composing music expresses both the head and the heart, and writing songs helps to heal, sing, and articulate feelings through words and sound. Writing below contributes to singer-songwriting.

<br>

I've said these words, I struggle with feeling like I'm copying other more established musicians. My family is from TN, and some music unveiled to me the connection between the South and the West Some women sometimes don't know as much about political and cultural history, and music, an intuitive form of expression helps to teach that when combined with books and curiosity.

<br>

## Song Lyrics ##
Songs share stories, human stories. Songs share stories of relationships. Songs express the heart of someone and speak to the heart of another. Songs capture words through feelings in catchy, punchy, witty, and clever ways. People can learn lessons from songs, sing along to songs, dance to songs, and learn to create their own songs. People can use music to heal.

<br>

## Popular Culture ##
Popular culture speaks subtly. One must think to understand different perspectives on popular culture. One must be alert to subtle, silent arguments telling what one is. Some of popular culture has depth. Some of popular culture expresses Soul. Some of popular culture seems shallow, and watered down.

<br>

## Music ##
Music is one form of cultural expression. Intuitively, music shares with people stories - stories of the past, stories of families, and stories of the present; stories of relationships, stories of politics, and stories of nature.

<br>

## Influences on Music ##
How does African, Chinese, and European fairytales from medieval period influence country music?
How does Shakespeare influence country music?
What is the connection between V, MT, Kentucky, TN, NC, and WV?
Old Hymns - "He is leading me" vs. "She is leading me"
"She" in country music
How is folk music created in America in comparison to other countries?

# Maps, History, Tennessee, Imagery, Stories, Professionalization, Bridges, A Spanish Lense, Culture, The Country, and Democracy #
## E Pluribus Unum ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to be say the right thing.
I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.
I am a body in a sea of bodies wanting to be free.
I am a heart in a sea of hearts crying out to love more.
I am a set of eyes in a set of eyes looking to see the good going on.
I am one of a kind in the sea of humanity.
Like a drop of water ripples outwardly, I am one of many leading to ripples outwardly in a sea of ripples.
I am one in a million. There are a million ways to say and do the same thing.

<br>

## Maps ##
A map, a tool, used in engineering that expresses natural phenomenon, physical relationships, and cultural and historical aspects of our world.

Bridges connect one place to another.

Maps show visually the relationships of places culturally and historically, and also for engineering purposes.

<br>

## Mapmaking ##
Map making
Bridge building
Trail blazing
Stair climbing
Dot connecting 

The past, the present, and future exiting all right now
The golden thread tying a knot through the universe 
The principle in everything

<br>


## Tennessee ## 
All these roads lead to and from home
From VA to TN from TN to VA
From PA to TN from TN to PA
From KY to TN from TN to KY
From AK to TN from TN to AK
From TX to TN from TN to TX
From MT to TN from TN to MT
From MI to TN from TN to MI
From GA to TN from TN to GA

Country music, country-western

<br>

## Shadow Imagery ##
Shadows of myself.
Shadows of leaves.
Shadows of trees.
Shadows of birds.

<br>


## Heart to Heart - Bells ##
Through the heart to heart I can hear the bells ringing
The harmony echoing out
The rainbow colors broadening through the sky and the earth
The crystal clear color making the path clear
The bells ringing from a distance waking us up
Calling us to a life of love

Those old church bells
Those old sweet hymns
That old clock ticking 

***Ring Them Bells* Sarah Jarosz**

<br>

## Trucks and Cargo Colors ##
Light green, royal blue, yellow, rusty orange, red, brown, dark blue, forest green. A chain of colors. A chain of nationalities being represented. A whole globe expressed through a chain of colors.

<br>

## The Trucks and the Industry ##
In Norfolk, during the pandemic, after stumbling and falling, I remember tuning into the port scenery. As a child, I remember growing up loving the industrial scenery, I remember loving the industrial scenery in Scotland, and I am increasingly grateful for it. 

<br>

## Perspective, Stories, the South ##
Around the south, there exist many individual perspectives. Someone sings about the South, and shares a story about the infrastructure, the culture, the group of people who created a land. Every individual in the land, in the South associate different meanings with this land.  Everyone comes from a different subjective standpoint to contributing to this economy and this society. Everyone associates his or her own meanings with what they hear. Songs can help people recall people, events, ideas, knowledge in different ways based on their own subjective standpoints. It's interesting that so many people grew up in the Southern United States and share common experiences but also have different meanings associated based on the time in which they were born, the state in which they were born, and the stories their ancestors shared.

I am grateful for the Abolitionists, the stories of overcoming, the stories of singing.

I am grateful that the South is also South America, and Mexico.

<br>

## Professionalization ##
The world will try to define you. People will try to box you in. People who fit into a profession will try to limit you and tell you that you cannot be them and that they have worked too hard. This is not true. A liberal education expands, and broadens, and helps people explore, and move out of their comfort zone. Anyone can learn something new. Anyone can try something out. People can work across disciplines, departments, try new things. The democratization of Life, Liberty, Happiness, and Education.

<br>

## Bridges ##
I just drove across another bridge today in Virginia, outside of Isle Wight County.
I braced myself.
I chose not to be afraid of the cars driving by.
I trusted in God.
I appreciated the water on the side, on the two sides.
I drove at the speed of traffic, in line with everyone else.
I sat the right distance behind the car in front.
I am an everyday common citizen on the road, part of the E Pluribus Unum.
Not being afraid of the cars driving by. 
Trusting in God. 
Appreciating the water on the side. 
Driving at the speed of traffic, in line with everyone else.
Sitting the right distance behind the car in front.
Being an everyday common citizen on the road, part of the E Pluribus Unum.

<br>

## Blue and Green Mountains - Virginia ##
Sweet Virginia, these blue and green mountains I am destined for.
It's heavenly to look to.

<br>

## Tennessee - The West ##
The path through from the East to the West
It was here all along but out of sight
It's a new frontier hidden from view
This whole country is one here for you and me
There are highways, rivers, trees and bridges
Pioneering thorugh unknown territory
Blazing trails
Discovering new roads and detours
It's a land of adventure
It's a land of danger
It's a land of fighting for freedom
It's a land for many, me and you

A beginning
The West, the moon
The South
The Earth
wax, wane
A new cycle
a closing
the south was the beginning, the first colony

<br>

## The Hidden Meaning ##
The hidden meaning beneath it all.
The connections are there.
The lines must be drawn.
Everything already exists, is whole, but the lines must be discovered.

**Interested in a poem that depersonalizes the experience on bridges.**
**Interested in writing a poem on the road, driving, road signals, car signals, and the harmony and symphony on the road.**

## EVERFI, Book ##
With EVERFI, to commit to the team, I remember appreciating the opportunity to work with an older man in engineering and drawing from qualities and experiences in rowing and "I Believe" to commit to the team while loving my supervisors better. I really appreciated the spirit of compassion, innovation, curiosity, commitment, persistence, and eagerness expressed throughout the business. It was cool to work in overlapping spheres, and learn about the different cultures expressed in the country, understand the relationship between technology and Black History. I really appreciated feeling a sense of community unfold around, and I remember loving developing healthier friendships, seeing people overcome through faith, and seeing family members that influenced the business. I remember witnessing the faith of colleagues that helped them to overcome challenges and that helped them to stay inspired.

<br>

## A Life in Snippets ##
Hashtags, instagrams, tweets, dashboards, github repos, poems, and paragraphs represent a life in snippets.

Everything online is a mediated, curated, snippeted, filtered view of the world that is a reflection of what is offline.

<br>

## Democracy ##
Democracy is a story of trust.
Democracy is a story of discussing to understand.
Democracy is a story of differences.
Democracy is a story of Truth.

<br>

## Dirt ##
Dirt hole.
Burying a hole.
It goes deep.
Hitting rock bottom.
The seed is buried deep within the ground.
The roots spread out.
It covers the whole ground.

<br>


----------

**Interested understanding whether history is objective or subjective.
Objective means that people live and understand in harmony and agreement. Objective means that people see the same thing. Objective means that people share the same thoughts and relate to the same center. Objective means that people are equal.
Subjective means that people live relatively and understand different perspectives. Subjective means that people see from different angles. Subjective means that people do not think the same thing. Subjective means that people are not equal. Subjective means that people have different beliefs.

<br>

## Argument ##
An argument, a perspective comes from the heart, an original point on something. There's tapestry in the words, there's structure, there's architecture. Everything connects.


----------


## Books ##
I am grateful for books. I love books. I love hearing the voices of people in books.
Books support democracy.
Books create value.
Books support learning something new each day.
Books empower people to express through words.
Books help people share feelings on the other side of the world.
Books help people understand what they cannot understand.

<br>

## In God We Trust ##
In God we trust, each day, in all of our business activites. It's amazing that people in the business world have faith and know God. It's on the dollar bill.
They say, 'money doesn't grow on trees.'

In God We Trust
Leaves turn Gold

<br>


## Childlike Heart ##
He woke me up to a childlike heart.
Childlike memories.
See all the beauty in this world. It's all around.

<br>

## Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow ##
Yesterday was so far away, but everything that existed yesterday exists today.
What happened yesterday is closer than to today when remembering.
What will happen tomorrow? I don't know.
An expansion of today. New ideas. Prosperity.

<br>


----------

**Interested in writing a creative piece on all the places that money flows, and all the values that money represents, and all the things that a $20 bill has touched.**

<br>

## A Society Driven by Money ##
A society driven by money, money makes the world go round, leaves turn into gold. Exchanges are driven by love and soul. In God We Trust. E Pluribus Unum.

<br>

## Struggling vs. Suffering ##
Struggling - fighting the good fight, persisting in the face of adversity, committing to the team, listening to mentors, working through the suffering, overcoming evil suggestions and beliefs with good, gratitude, helpfulness, and saying no to the "tempter" when wanting to do what seems wrong but desiring to do what's right.

Suffering - pain in silence with no ability while feeling like one can't speak up, one can't be heard, one can't be understood, always on the outside looking in, and like someone is being a mouthpiece for one's thoughts, feeling guilt and shame and guilt and shame, and endless ties to people who do not care.

Pain - empathizing with the needs with someone else, feeling the inflicted harm of someone, feeling the negative energy from another's heart, feeling the lack within, the lack of ability, the blockage.

<br>

## Seasons Changing ##
Something is sweeping through as the seasons change
Old leaves die,
buds come to bloom,
there's another cycle ahead.
Bowing and bending with the universe I am in.
Flowing through time.
Growing with the seasons.
Adapting to the change.
Swaying with the earth.

<br>

## Worlds Apart ##
Seeing eye-to-eye,
meeting heart-to-heart,
while two worlds apart we are.
Greeting each other,
exchanging views,
hearing each other,
and loving the world as it is we are.
Shifts, changes, adaptations, and dances
in the same world we experience with different languages

<br>


## Falling, Rising ##
Falling low, rising higher to the destiny

<br>

## Farmer's Market ##
Open red and white windows
Fresh fruit smells
Neighbors gathering from everywhere in the city

Flowers for your mother to keep in her kitchen
Food for your father to cook

## Home Sweet Home ##
Home sweet home
where screen doors are wide open
where tomatoes are fresh
where there's the sweet sound of peace
where birds are singing
where momma's hugs are priceless
where the noise from the pool carries like the whistle of the train
where the flowers are waiting to be smelled
where the peaches are so sweet
where the peanuts are so tasty
where the breeze cools my neck
Home sweet home
to where my family is from
to where the summers were spent

<br>

## Medieval Alt-Country ##
Traveling back into the past
Traveling forward into the future
Going to long, lost worlds in the past or future that exist all right now
This is alt-country
Seeing all the people who used to live or who live in the future

<br>

## Time ##
He was old Mr. Time.
He had watched down from heaven on all the days.
He had lived through this all bfore.
He saved us all from things we could not foresee.
He knew how to synch us up.

He's got two hands circling around everything

Clock watching
Father Time
Counting down the time, the hours, the minutes
"In the hands of time"

Watching the clock eternity is for everyone.
Tic toc.
Has it been a minute?
When will an hour pass?
Waiting for time to pass?
Checking on the clock.

He coordinates the dance of life
He knows all from up above
He saves me from being late
He synchs me up with just who I need to be with
Mr. Time, heaven, coming down to earth
Stopping a delay
He plans my days for them to go my way.
He knows just where you are.
He steps over stones to get you to where you need to be.
The hands of the clock ticking through the universe
You can't turn back time
He only moves forward
He never stops
He lives outside of everything
He has his two hands in the earth ticking
He knows where you are
He knows how to pause to save
He creates the dance of the universe
He holds you tight
He leads to people meeting by coincidence
He leads to being on point
He leads to the right place at the right time
In the hands of time
I'm right where I'm supposed to be
I'm at the right place

The waltz of the unvierse
the meeting and greeting of hearts shining through faces

Stop girl, don't be jealous
You've got it all too
Take a hard look in the mirror
That other girl is so loved

It's ok to feel jealous
But girl stop comparing because you have much more than you think
She might be freerer, but girl, stop, the same light comes out of both of you
You all spring from the same source

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Girl, stop, take a hard look in the mirror and see what all you have and you got
Count your blessings
You got it all going too

Jealousy
The poison to my soul
The eating of my helath
She's so perfect, I'm not

## From the East to the West ##
The sun rises in the East and sets in the west.
From the rising to the setting.
There's one day and one night.
The stars dance and sing their songs, individually and collectively.
The truth echoes.
The earth rumbles.
The place where it once began begins again.
The setting sun that sets in the west was there at the birth and the moon shines its light on the east to show all things brand new.

<br>

## This Holy Book ##
This holy book, it's everywhere I go.
Hotel rooms, psych wards, libraries, and churches.
You'll find this book every where you go.
It goes back to King James, before King James.

It's a torch for people.
It helps people heal.

**Willie Nelson wrote a song on the Holy Bible**

## Ode to an Insect ##
Ode to an insect looking through the window, flying through the air, nibbling at my sandwich

Ode to a spider web next to sticky sprinkles of green grass on the windoe

Insects, caterpillar crawling on the ground, a new friend

The ant knows what he's doing
He's enjoying a good lunch
He's curious about the leaves
The dirt is his home

Creepy crawlers, critters, crickets
They know what they're doing
We have a friend in them

The ants are busy with what they know they need to do to live

Ode to a squirrel

Sun shining
the smell of the lunch at the pool
the railroad near by
the fireworks
family's homes
a towel on a driveway

love of the sound of their voices

Interconnectedness

Church domes in the midst of green trees

the American flag flying everywhere

Highway noises

Love on the internet highway

## Bottled Up in a Bottle, Not My Heart ##
All these things I've done wrong, I toss it into a bottle and toss it out to sea.

Bottled up in a Bottle, not my heart

<br>

## Another's Lens ##
Looking at life and everything around through the lens of someone else.

<br>

## He ##
He's a working man
There's dirt in his fingers from working so hard
He's up before dawn every morning
He's ready to go
He knows how to make people smile and laugh
He tells great jokes
He knows all the stores
He knows everyone in this old town

**Tennessee Entrepreneurship**

<br>

## He ##
His voice is beautiful.
It makes me happy to hear his voice.
He's got that smile.
That rock'n roll style.
He knows how to light up the whole town with a laugh and some charm.
He lighten the mood.
He'll calm your smile.
He'll say 'thank you' and mean it
He'll say it with a 'thank you very much'

<br>

## She ##
A small town girl.
A reputation that's loud.
Everyone knows.
I already know.
The writing is on the wall/
The word spreads.
The gossip stings.
The cutoff hurts.
Now an outcasted girl.

<br>

## Where You are From, Where You are From From ##
I appreciate where you're from, where you're from from.
I appreciate where your ancestors come from.
I appreciate where you are from.
I appreciate your story, your background, your interests, and your passions.
I appreciate your testimonies and how you have come clean and overcome.
I appreciate what you dream of doing. I appreciate you as more than a job.
I appreciate what gives you meaning.
Everyone has a story.
Everyone has a place of origin.
Everyone has their roots to celebrate.
Everyone has a place where they are from.
Some people feel displaced.
Some people feel like their roots are ignored or dulled.
Everyone belongs to the Earth.

<br>

<br>


## My Mom and I ##
My mom and I are on different journeys.
We are two different people with two different perspectives and career projectories.
I began to grow deeper in understanding the perspective of President Barack Obama's mother. I tried to at least.
I realized the connection between the Arab world and Spain.
I realized the connection between the woman who inspired MLK, Jr.
I realized that Norfolk is not that different from Memphis or Nashville. There are common truths, roots, binds, images, stories, and scenery with shipping, trains, trucks, racial tension, and civil rights.
I realized the importance of true self-government.
I have felt very angry about sexuality and traditional gender roles in the South.
I have tried to emulate her and read the books she read and learn more about politics in the way she transformed in my own way.

<br>

## The Collective ##
We are all one of the same.
We are all made with the same blood.
We all have faces with two eyes, two ears, a noise, a mouth, and a smile or a frown.
We all have two arms, two hands, two legs, and two feet.
We all have hearts with interests, passions, a way of viewing and perceiving the world.
There exist many of us humans like there exist many leaves on a tree, many trees in the forest, many flowers in the field, many berries in a patch, and many homes in a city.

<br>

## Ripple Effect ##
When you sing, you inspire everyone around you to sing.
When you read, you inspire everyone around you to read.
When you dance, you insprie everyone around you to dance.
When you pray, you inspire everyone around you to pray.

Plop in the water and then it ripples out
A drop in the water ripples out
It's quiet, and graceful, and peaceful, and flowing

I love all the people the man loves in the restaurant.
I love the man in the restaurant and the world and universe and interests and passions inside him.
I love all the people Taylor Swift loves and inspires.
I love the light in all the people that helped Taylor Swift light up and all the people they've loved and inspired and helped.

<br>

## We All Look to the Same Universe ##
We all look to the same sky, moon, stars, and sun.
We all walk through this earth and look to the trees and the homes.
We all look to the same Truth, the same truths.
The universe is one.
How does how I see and express differ from how you see and express?
What makes you you?
What makes me me?

We all look to the same flowers.

It's a universe.
The prime mover of the universe.
The author writing the book.
The painter painting the colors.
The thought behind the existence.
The breath behind the life and the raising up.
The animator behind the expression.

<br>

## Long Road ##
I am with you for the long road ahead and the changing seasons
There's a long life to live with you
Many roads to see
Many paths to find
Many people to love with you

The road is good, it leads back home, high heaven
Life is a journey that started at home, and ends at home
Life is a journey that leads closer to oneself
Life is a journey that leads to an expanded self
Life is a journey with interests, hope, stories, progress
Step by step
Destination by destination
The path, the trail is marked
Leaving behind love, lessons, hurt, pain

The next step, the next destination has already been paved, it has already been through
People cross paths
Some meant to stay
Others meant for a lesson

Many many miles with you down these roads

Entwined, loved, knotted in union
Crossing paths, lessons learned

Not the landing, but the passing by, the journey to a greater destiny, destination

Moments measured by love, grace, surprises, awe, joy
Everlasting moments

Journey to understanding

Living with you until you die 

<br>

## Two Seeds ##
Two seeds in a pod
Just the two of us have
The two of us together are greater and stronger and better and bigger than each one of us alone
You help me be me
I help you be you 
The two of us toggether are bigger and better than me without you and you without me
There's more to love you show me
There's more to life I show you

With you I bury these seeds in the ground and say "I love you"
The whole earth, the sun, the sky, the birds, the trees, the home rise up into love and grow with the two of us

Write a love note
Bury it in the guround
Build a house and live with it underground
When we're old, I hope to unbury this note, and see how our seeds grew and changed

We are the best of friends
Two seeds of love
Buried in the good soil of the earth
That nurtures us and helps us live full lives

Growing underground
Wedded to the earth
Dying to the earth
The message of love spreads through the ground, the earth and resonates with everyone on earth

seeds of hope, love, joy

I give you a seed of love, and you give to me a seed
we grow and gorw like the earth

I love everyone that I meet

just you and me together better than you and me alone

I want to live forever with you and love how you love and watch you grow old with me
I want to create life with you

Run to you back again and again
with you I share this home
It's lasting, it's founded, it's grand
A hug I welcome from you day after day, night after night
 
<br>

## Lifetime ##
There's a liftime of love
There's a lifetime of joy
There's a lifetime measured by moments shared by you and me
There's a lifetime of seasons changing while some things stay the same
There's a lifetime journey
There's a lifetime of learning
There's a lifetime in this world
There's a mini world within everyone that's a reflection of the universe in someone
There's a lifetime of ideas
There's a lifetime to be happy

There's a lifetime to love both day and night
There's a lifetime to grow older in age and younger at heart
THere's a lifetime to see the beauty all around

There's nothing like the two of us

There's a new seed for me and you
For two hearts that are so true

To grow within this earth

I got you by my side

<br>

## You Plus Me ##
You plus me add up to one
Together as one we're stronger and steadier
Like 2 birds on an electric wire
Like 2 pages in a book
Or 2 leaves in a tree

This love between our hearts
Lasts throughout all time
It lasts until the end
It lasts through the storm

Me plus you equal one
Without each other we're better and bolder
Like 2 birds on a rooftop
Lke 2 seeds in a pod
Or 2 notes on a music sheet

You plus me go on and on
Like lines on a page that continue forever across
Like 2 ducks paddling
Like 2 flowers in a garden
Or 2 rays of sun

Yo plus me. It's an equation that starts and ends in love
Two hearts better than one

You plus me equal an equation to a bigger and better life
You plus me

2 love birds with hearts that are true

It's about the two of us
You and me coming together to become something greater than we are apart

Our two hearts meet
Your heart hears mine, mine yours
Forever the truth echoes out and ripples out from our two hearts meeting
Fusion
the whole world knows with two lovers love and meet

Forever with you eternal day and night
eternal road

Infinite day and night for you and me
The long road ahead
The highway system
Music hihgway
Interconnections
Synching up

You're the reason I get up each morning
I live for the light in you
I love a heart that's true

You're the one that I want
I want to stand with you 
through the test of time

All of our dreams become real
I want to live with you forever
I want our lives to leave marks in the trails on earth

You plus me, it equals we
You plus me, it adds up to love
You plus me, it's an equation alright
It's a love that lasts
It's a love that's true

We're stronger together
We can't be without each one of us
The moments that our true hearts share
It's a love equation alright

<br>

## Kissing Game ##
Kissing game like kids
You'll find the right one
But save your kisses until the one
Don't give your kisses away
The right one will come
Your kisses are your to keep

<br>

## Two Sides of the Same World ##
I'll love you until you die
The two of us come from two sides of the same world
There's a whole world inside you and a whole world inside me
I learn from you
You learn from me

A spark of the world that makes you you

It's a world full of people, a word full of love, look all around, see what you see

<br>

## It's An Open Book ##
It's an open book ahead.
All the pages waiting to be written.
Pages have been written.
It's an open book ahead.

<br>

## Start Each Day with a Question ##
What are you thinking about today?
How can I listen to God more clearly?
How can I repent?
How can I learn something new?
What ideas am I or others thinking about?
How am I letting go of something false?
How can I understand a passage in the rear light?

<br>

## Interracial Couples ##
The love between interracial couples is like the white keys and the black keys on the piano coming together in harmony.

<br>

## Attitude on Life ##
I have sounded and attacked like President Donald Trump in some ways.
Donald Trump supports people with valid points. Concerns over infrastructure, technology, agriculture, and preserving what's best in the Republic are valid.
I have met President Barack Obama. The purpose of life is to transform. All of humanity is transforming at once.
I aspire to sound, and be thoughtful, and secure like Present Barack Obama, who I have met.
I am interested in party switching, and the progress in The United States of America.
I reflect on the ideals of home, Reconstruction and Civil Rights, integration, and more.

<br>

## Working with EVERFI ##
I was grateful that through the doubt, God intuitively led me to a place just right for me and everyone, where I was integrated with family members and community members doing their life work in the world.
I was grateful to deliberately choose to work for a leader who loved African American history and shared African American history.
I was grateful to deliberately choose to help people understand how perception can shift behavior, though I did not fully understand that at the time.
I was grateful to appreciate harmony expressed in the workplace with people from all different cultural perspectives in the country and the world.
I was grateful to learn about the Natives in Montana, learn about the beloved people from Kentucky, learn about the technologists from California, and learn about the Americans in Washington, DC.
I was grateful to gain an understanding of what it means to feel "white privilege" in the workplace while loving what those from other cultural backgrounds are offering the world, the nation, the community, and the business world.
I was grateful to see the spirit of compassion being expressed by people in the workplace, with the darkness in the world being transformed into light.
I was grateful for company-wide events that brought people together in union "twixt the darkness and the light".
I was grateful to be part of the "THIS IS IT" moment when things started booming, roaring, becoming the full thing.
I was grateful to see the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. shared in an engineering class being reflected through the business.
I was grateful to build solutions and be a part of the "Smart Things Should Build Things Movement".
I didn't know everything there is to know about African American History, but I was grateful to start a lifelong journey of appreciating the country, learning about perception, learning about people, working in teams, learning about African American History, and preventing violence on the basis of sex and race.
I was grateful to defend true womanhood, the "Princesses of Peace" who are able to lead, and appreciate true manhood.

People may come from different perspectives, different sides, different points of view, but unite in the divine interest, expressing their talents in original, heart-felt ways.

<br>

## The Study of History ##
God's story is forever unfolding. The Bible is a history book that shares the chronicles of people, and life lessons. Every individual who is born on Earth is born into an existing story of the collective mankind. Every individual who is born on Earth has a story being created by God and him or herself. We are all part of a grand story that is ever-evolving and ever-progressing. Everyone has a story of his or her own singing through the earth by God to overcome evil with good.

<br>

## Race - Why Do We Talk about Race? Why Do We Not Talk About Race? ##
What is race? A group or category of people. There are individuals within the group or the category. People tend to rank individuals within the group or the category. Race is not the only way to rank or group. Why do I talk about race? To understand how someone perceives the world, to understand someone's cultural background, to appreciate the beauty of race, to understand someone in a different group. Why do I not talk about race? To respect boundaries, to talk about more elevated ideas above the physique.

## Black Lives Matter, Interracial Relationships, and Christian Science ##
I think that it's great that Black partnerships can be formed and that they have a right to do that and love their Black power.
I love thinking about the idea of "two birds of a feather" for two Black people as well (it's mentioned in Sister Sledge, and Black Women's Songs)
I was aware of the police reactions to Black lives but maybe I didn't do enough to respond but I deepen my thinking now to love these people I am aware of.
I do my work to heal from prejudices and see the full human.
I appreciated the opportunities to engage with Black Lives in college who were leaders and community members and friends but I had prejudices.
I appreciated the opportunities to engage with Black Lives in college who were leaders and community members and friends but I had prejudices.
I appreciated efforts to transform my thinking.
I remember the Christ I saw expressed in people from the German Club and other people at Christmas parties.
I remember engaging with Black men on the street in DC and not thinking anything less of them.
I remember chaning my thinking around housekeepers to see the full human.
I remember the pull to be a traditional white person, whatever that means.
I remember regretting not listening to Desmond enough and he expressed concerns, and I awas aware of him.
I remember being open to learning from another perspective.
I remember taking the time to be more aware of their names.
I remember zooming in to see the guns on the police and questioning that.
I remember thinking highly of Black men at Church I saw and appreciating their talents.
I remember getting very angry over the South, Debuts partly because of racial issues and partly because of being rejected and excluded and isolated, I remember getting very angry over feeling like I had failed and had no social life but I did enjoy some social outings with people, I remember getting very angry over people exerting power over me at working, mispronouncing my name, harassing me and streetcalling me, and bullying me in their apartment
I remember retaliating very heavily and threatening people partly out of accusations of being petty, partly out of fear, and I remember being strategically excluded from people
I am grateful for healthy homes in Norfolk
My immediate instinct was that the romanticism of the South reminded me of ancestors and grandparents but I was also conscious of the racism traditionally in Georgia and VA and TN
I have delved more deeply to learn about specific stories of people and what has happened to them
I am grateful for people I have met on the street 
I remember deepening my awareness of surroundings in Norfolk, neighborhoods I had not fully paid attention to because they are traditioanlly less safe, or suroundings in VA and WV in the country
I am grateful for people's love of Black lives influencing music
I remember the work of the dancers at Norfolk Academy
Tokenism, Prejudice, Breaking Barriers, Gun Violence separate from Interracial Issues separate from Prison and Criminal Reform
I am grateful for abolitionists and women who freed the slaves and the love that children can have for these role mdoels
I am grateful for all the work EVERFI is doing and the work kids all across the nation are learning about entrepreneurship and Black history
I remember God leading me to get more in touch with my authentic self at EVERFI
I remember reading the Addie books as a kid and I remember healthy relationships with Jasmine in chorus, in Baltimore, and in grade school

## Women and Engineering ##
I remember working in the field of engineering as the only women and feeling really really uncomfortable and fearful and like I didn't belong
I am grateful for the other men in the engineering classes

## The Agitation in America ##
When the riots fell down on the White house, the breakdowns happened at the Confederate Monuments, and the sense of loss and of lack stirred up agitation,
the American dream felt out of reach to people. The American dream is not lost. What is great about America remains in memory, waiting to be reborn. What is wrong about America will be revisited and retold. America, founded on a rock, will always represent freedom to humanity. Have no fear, American people, we are all God's sons and daughters, and there's a new day under the Sun. What's great about America remains great. What needs to be known about America will be known. The dross of the country will be removed, and the gold of the country will be refined and come to the surface. There's newness for the country coming to life. There's grace, equity, equality, and justice for today. The governors represent the people, all the people. Nothing is lost, nothing about America's roots are being displaced. Everyone in the country belongs - all races, all creeds, all cultures, all religions. America, a melting pot. We were and can all be immigrants made new, we were and can all be explorers of the new earth, we were and can all be settlers finding our place to rest and be at peace, we were and can all be freedom-finders, no matter our background. Americans, tied to the land, has a new day in the Sun. The land belongs to everyone. America is not at the center, but represents freedom-finding, for all ethnic backgrounds and races.

<br>

## A Revolution ##
There's a revolution going on of loving strangers. There's a revolution going on of loving the earth and being a steward. There's a revolution going on where everyone can sing and dance, or create art and write. There's a revolution going on where people see the truth in each other's faiths and religions. There's a revolution going on from the ground up, through books, through media, through one act towards change at a time.

<br>

## Traditional Southern Life ##
My mom was a traditional Southern mom, but she encouraged me to become a career woman. I became more of a career woman because I felt angry about feeling "too simple" like some people from the rural south do, too dependent on men, and incapable of understanding everything I read in the political economy; I also felt critical of aspects of the domestic economy because of how I heard my mom share opinions and her perspective, and since then, I have felt cut off from the sense of Southern home, even though I feel *home* as the *consciousness of good* ([Christian Science Hymn](https://hymnary.org/text/home_is_the_consciousness_of_good)). I learn to bring my work in the political economy into the domestic economy, recultivate my love of home, and use skills in the home.

My mom always felt like the ideal Southern woman, and I have felt angry sometimes over that; or when I see other women seeming like the ideal Southern woman, I have felt inferior. But I learn to express gratitude for all mankind, and love the consciousness of good more and more.

More broadly, I love home on earth with all of humanity.

<br>

## Another Year Lighter ##
It's another year lighter.
Everything I once knew is made known more clearly and deeply.
These lessons I've learned.
These people I've grown closer to.

# Creative Writing - Independent Writing #

## Engineering, A Career of Singing ##
The work of engineering, a career of singing, and nature, and where the constructions of mankind meet nature.

<br>

## An Aerial View ##
At the moment of death and wanting to escape the weight of this physical existence, thought lifts up. Thought lifts up and flies freely up above with an inner sight lifts into the sky. Thought lifts up so that it feels like mentally flying above and seeing the whole city, all the mountains, all the clouds from up above. Everything can be seen from a birds-eye view. Everything moves down below. A beautiful scenery down below. Inner freedom, freedom from the entrapment of the physicality. Living fully inwardly in the sky like a bird mentally.

Airplanes shooting in the sky
White trails
Sailing above it all

<br>

## Ribbons  on the Tree, Engineering ##

Ribbons

<br>

## The Evening Sun ##
The evening sun reflecting off rooftops.
The river running it's course down wide open spaces.
The log river view.
An aerial perspective over all the land.

<br>

## Trash ##
The used material that people do not want.
The things to dispose of and throw away.
The containers empties of the substance to digest.
The leftover goods, the pouring over of used goods.
The things that can be reused and recycled to create something new.

<br>

Yellow, read, and orange flags in the dirt
The tall grass sprouting up

<br>

## The Highway System ##
Driving down these highways like driving old school wagons.

History of wagons

Back on the highway again
These are the roads that heal
Where the sounds are so good
On I 40 where the music resounds

Way back when on this old coach road to the west

<br>

## Traffic Signals ##
Cars talking to each other through signals and signs

Walking to the streetlight
I see a woman in the car sitting poised
with the right blinker on, signaling a turn.

Walking across the bridge
I see the line of peopels' cars in afternoon rush hour
with lights shining on the back of them all.

The car with the right red blinker on 
talking to the car behind it 
with no blinker on going straight

Two cars in line in the left lane with left blinkers on waiting to turn
A car in line in the middle lane with a motor on

<br>

## Bricks ##
Day by day,
brick by brick,
stone by stone,
woodpiece by woodpiece,
this house is being built.
The ground is laid.
The space is new and fresh.
The clay is sprinkled on the floor, the ladder is against the wall, and the light shines through the windows.

Action by action,
greeting by greeting,
morning by morning,
ladder by ladder,
this day is alive.
The town is moving.
The neighborhood is vivid.
The greenery spreads on the fence, and the sun shines down with heat.

Meeting by meeting,
outing by outing,
setting by setting,
prayer by prayer,
this day is done.
The home is at peace.
The lights are dimmed.
The time is there for rest, and the darkness draws near.


----------


2 * 2, 2 at a time
picking up bricks
stacking them well

knock knock knock
knocking at the wall
each of the bricks in their place
the motor on, zooming in the background
the car screeching as it turns right to the house

<br>

## A Dose of Reality ##
The sounds of the neighborhood working together in harmony for good.

<br>

## Transportation ##
From port to port across this large, moving world, everyone is on a journey, carrying freight, goods, and objects through ships trains, and trucks. The freedom to share cultures across the world, through traveling drivers, expressing freedom, loving those roots, and paying these tools. Life is a journey, America is the land free to shift its foundation from one that appreicates the colonized version of the world to one that appreciates the de-colonized version fo the world.

<br>

## International Train ##
These train cars and freight and cargo have been and come from everywhere.

<br>

## It Starts At the Port ##
It starts at the port. Every morning, the orange, green, white, and blue trucks drive from the shipyard to the streets. The trucks drive harmoniously down Hampton Roads like the birds do when they fly. Where do they go? From the driveways in the port city to the shipyard to the country roads. There's a beautiful chain of freight traveling through the port cities and then through the country. And some have American flags hanging in the windows.

<br>

## From Port to Port ##
From port to port the sun shines in every place from different angles. We all look to the same sun from different corners of the Earth from different places in the Universe.

<br>

## Norfolk to Memphis ##
From Norfolk to Memphis and back a million times.
These are the cities I love.
These are the cities my family loves.

The whistle blows in both.
The rivers are flowing in both.

Memphis, I hold you dear in my heart forever.

my old hometown
from Norfolk to Charlotte to Memphis to Montclaire to Memphis

hear the train rollin in the summer time by the pool

travelling thorugh Memphis
it's my home sweet home
there's a love that shines through darkness here

<br>

## Home ##
My home sweet home in the sweet old south, the land of the free

## Lessons from Grandparents ##
Granmama - wide smiles, dancing, greeting people for who they are, lover of color and flowers, lover of the Catholic church
Dattee - deep listener, reader, the human psyche, lover of Church, historian
Nam - lover of the English language, the joy of learning, Shakespeare's plays, Christian Science

<br>

## Grandparents ##
I remember all the stories and lessons my grandparents shared.
The stories they shared sing through me intuitively.
I recall them like a piece of music breathing through me.

I love the Good Lord who "hears my prayers" first thing in the morning when the sun rises, the birds chirp, and there's time to eat blueberry muffins like my grandmother.
I love the sound of "Hello, Gorgeous", saying it's a new day in the neighborhood to appreciate every detail in people's lives.
I love the sound of "You stole my birthday", stated by my grandfather, and the love of books, history, symbolism, and psychology.
I hear the sound of faith running deep through my grandfather's love of church and his family.

I love the stories my other grandmother shares of ancestors discovering the country, family members in the shipping industry, and favorite literature like Faulkner and Shakespeare.
I love the sound of the grandfather clock, the sound of the birds tweeting, and the sound of the bird clock with a glass of water and a dictionary nearby.
I love the laughs shared with my other grandfather, and some good family music playing and family tales.
I love the hugs and affection my grandfather gives.

I love the song of the South singing through the lumber industry and the railroads in Memphis like my great grandfather.
I love the beauty of Soul reflected through my great grandmother during the age of Jazz music in Memphis.
I love the good luck rushing through my great grandfather McCardell's Irish blood.
I love the songs of peace "like a river" sung through my great grandmother.

My grandmother always taught me to sing with all my heart.
My grandfather always pushed me to play a little louder.
My grandfather always taught to share a good laugh.

<br>

## Love the People ##
I love the people she, he, they love throughout the day

<br>

## Norfolk to Memphis ##
From Norfolk to Memphis and back a million times.
These are the cities I love.
These are the cities my family loves.

The whistle blows in both.
The rivers are flowing in both.

<br>

## Thank You ##
Thank you for holding the door and making me feel like a lady.
Thank you for touching my heart and making me remember home.
Thank you for the song and helping me feel loved.
Thank you for the head nod and helping me feel cool.
Thank you for the concern for my health and helping me recover.
Thank you for asking me to dance and not making me feel bad.

The love and the smile is in the silence.
The anger is in the lack of voice.
In the bitterness and the loss, I found a voice that you happened to save.

The freedom is in the independence.
The spirit is all around.
The healing is in the mystery of the whirlwind of it all.
The joy is in the leaves moving around.

You thought you had an enemy
You really had a friend in disguise
You thought you were being laughed at
You really were being taught a powerful lesson
The light in the darkness it's so strong

It's ok to cry
It's ok to let the tears flow
It's ok to cry
It's like the water droplets after a heavy rain

You come waltzing in
Feeling like you new what I needed
You told me in the wrong way
You woke me up to a side of me yearning, crying out loud to be free

<br>

## He's An Old Time Boy ##
He's an old time boy
He's been here for so many incarnations
Many lifetimes he's reborn on this planet
He has come to wake up to the destiny of life
He's here for the true glory
He's here to help
He's here to share a good laugh and a smile

<br>

## It's Not a Fairy Tale ##
It's not a fairy tale
It's not a happy ending
It's a sad ending
It's a harsh ending
It's an ending with bitterness, reactions, jealousy, vengeance, indignance, frustration and anger. I feel all these feelings at once.
Life keeps going on.
Beauty is still there.
I'm still alive.
Better days are coming.
New dreams can still be born and awakened.
There's still a rainbow shining, smiling through while all alone, in the psych ward, the ambulance car, the cell with white walls.
The rainbow is the smile of a stranger, the colors in the hospital building, the stars in everyone's hearts outside of these gray walls.
All around me the sun will always peek through at the end.

Dream a different dream
Colors of the rainbow
Reflecting all the people, all the generations
Everlasting, forever, happily ever after

<br>

## Dream ##
It was all a dream.
It was a loud dream.
All my dreams I heard.
Better dreams on their way.
More conscious dreams.
Dreams that last a lifetime.

Dream a different dream

<br>

## A World Always Moving ##
There's a world outside these walls of stars and of colors
There's a world outside of movement
There's a world outside of trees and leaves and sunlight 
There's a world outside of people loving, living, dancing, learning, acting, thinking, teaching, helping, selling
There's a symphony, a harmony outside

<br>

## Woman in Black ##
I'm the one who turned into the girl wearing all black.
The girl in black. That's who I beecame.
I wear it for the women working to be bold.
I wear it for the women being strong in a man's world.
I wear it for the run-down and the weary.
I wear it to show this sentiment of depression.

## Whirlwind ##
Losing it all in the whirlwind.
Going crazy.
Spinning in circles in the hotel motel.
It's all falling to pieces.
It's like a storm brewing.
The yanking and the pulling.
The pushing and the hitting.
The kicking and the screaming.
The world pushing me around.
The world spinning me around.
The world pushing me down.
The world beating me up.
It's a cruel, cruel world for sure.
I can be cruel.
You can be cruel.
We can all be cruel, and we can all be kind.
The world pushing me around.
I've said this a million times.
I'll say it again just a little bit louder.
I sound like a broken record.
It's on repeat.
All these concerns.
All these pain points.
They keep showing up.
I try to explain myself.
I try to understand.
I repeat myself.
The deepest wounds.
It's a broken record.
Ignored. Rejected. Denied. Unheard.
Do you hear me?
Change the tone.
Switch the chord.
Shift the tune.
Take the time to pause and stop the broken record.

We've already heard this a thousand times before.
He goes after the broken hearted.
Her heart is broken.
He...
She...
It sounds like a broken record.
A broken record of hurt, pain, and hardship.

<br>

## Bad Words ##
All the curse words.
They're creating noise on the street.
The mean two different things depending on how you say it.

<br>

## "Heartbreak Hotel" ##
Day after Day
On the road again

Night after Night
Spending time in a hotel

It's a lifesaving drive
It's a heartbreak hotel

These daystops in gas stations
These nights in hotels

It's a road trip to calm the raging heart
It's a round trip back home to heal the breaking heart

It tore my heart, my heart is breaking, my heart spinning
I'm spending night after night praying and dancing in hotels

Look at these people
Cheerful people everywhere

They're serving the world
They're serving the country

It was a heartbreak hotel experience
It broke my heart
I was so confused
I felt lonely
There were people all aroud
I prayed in a car
From hotel to hotel this heart of mine so fragile and broken

It was a heartbreak hotel
It was no real relationship
It was all fantasy
Baby he med my needs
He knew what I needed to know
He knew how to reach me
He was never my baby
but baby it was a heartbreak hotel

<br>

**Heartbreak Hotel *by Elivs Presley***

<br>

## Broken Record ##
The coiled sin
The making a scene
The need for attention
The again and again and again
The repeat of words
The over-explanation
Saying the same thing over and over and over again without being heard
Hearing the same tactics to hurt and bring down over and over and over
It's a broken record
Nothing is changing
Nothing is shifting 
It's a broken record, stuck on repeat, stuck on the pain, stuck on the explanation, stuck on the hurt

Can you really not get over it?
Can you not get over it?
Can I not be heard?
It strikes a chord.

I've said the same thing again and again
I'm going over the hurt again and again
I'm trying to make a point again and again
I feel like I'm not being heard though

I sound the same again and again
I am loud and broken again and again
I repeat the same challenge again and again
I feel like I'm not being heard though

I circle around again and again
It's like a broken record circling around and around again and again
Again and again I circle around this broken pain point
Will I ever be heard?

I start to heal
The lighbulb goes on
I see something new
I start to hear and be heard

The pain comes back
It circles around and around once more
I feel like a broken record again once more
Will it ever stop?

I heal some more
There's an epiphany
I hear something that rings a bell and strikes a chord
I become something new with everyone around

I heal more
I learn to fix the record
I do something new and create new patterns
The record becomes new

<br>

## Talking Over ##
Writing over someone's words
Assuming what someone's thinking
Making a rash judgment call
Not listening clearly to the other side

<br>

## Guitar ##
The pain of playing guitar.
The heartbreaking guitar playing.
Sticking with it.
Letting it hurt.
Bearing the pain.

This sweet guitar
why?
why?
I'm in pain over you
It's in everyone's hands
It's in everyone's arms

Walking into that country store
I see those badass boots
A sign with a gun and some cowboy boots
I see the history of the gun
Why oh why is everything centered around guns?
Why should I feel threatened at the gas station?

## A Chord Struck ##
It was a hit.
It really struck a chord.
It captured the heart.
IT reminded me of those country tunes I listened to.

It rung a bell.
It revived my heart.
It brought back all those memories of home sweet home.

<br>

## Put It Down ##
The drink is put down.
The bottle is in the trash.
The phone is put away.
The substance no longer makes me better.

I am whole within
I know who I am
I know I am free and equal

The idols are people
They don't have power
They are loved and loving expressions

I am human too
I know who I am
I know I am capable of something

<br>

## Familiar Streets ##
These old familiar streets.
I recognize them through a song.
I recognize them through a visit.
I sigh with relief, "this is my home".

I recognize the ducks.
I recognize the people with a warm embrace.
I recognize the streets.
I recognize the home.
I recognize the smells.
I recognize the birds.
I recognize the love.
I recognize the harmony.
I recognize the light.
I recognize the trees.

<br>

## Playing the Fool ##
Making things worse.
Playing the fool.
Doing dumb things. 
Being exposed, exposing oneself.

If you 'play the fool' learn how to play the fool
Play it really well
Learn the lesson
Learn it the hard way
Give up the foolishness and foolery
Let it go
Let it mvoe through the drain
Learn the lesson
Learn it well
Wisen up
Become who you're born to be and move on

The fool it makes us all
Playing it cool or playing the fool
A crush
A secret admirer
"sweet nothings"

Playing the fool
Playing it well
Being a tool of the snakey serpent

Playing the fool
Making a scene
Letting myself fall for the trick

<br>

## Rough Night ##
It's been a rough night yelling, sorrow, frustration, sadness, loneliness, and depression.
The music always resounds.

<br>

## The Mask ##
You're not the mask.
The mask comes off.
It's a game of make-believe and pretend.
Masking the hurts and the pain.
You're so much more than that.
Make-believe, pretend

<br>

## Serpents ##
Serpents attack her in her sleep.
Snakes come out of her mouth.
It's creepy.
It's weird.
It's cruel.
It's harsh.
This cruel cruel world hits her hard.

<br>

## It's Ok to Cry ##
It's ok to cry when left alone.
It's ok to cry when unsure.
It's ok to cry when hitting the wall.
It's ok to cry, and it's ok to cry cry cry alone.

It's ok to cry when you've failed.
It's ok to cry when you've shared too much.
It's ok to cry when she's hurt you.
It's ok to cry, and it's ok to cry cry cry alone.

It's ok to cry when no one cares.
It's ok to cry when you're stuck once again.
It's ok to cry when the script has flipped.
It's ok to cry, and it's ok to cry cry cry alone.

Someone will be there to pick you up.
Someone will be there to say it's ok.
Someone will be there to wipe off your tears.
Someone will be there to share a sweet smile.
Someone will be there to answer your plea.
Someone will be here with just the right words.
Someone will be there who understands.
Someone will be there to open the door.
Someone will be there to let you in.

It's ok
It's really going to be ok

There's nothing like a good laugh that helps to lighten the mood.
Laugh it off. Cry it off.
It's ok to cry.
It's good to laugh.

Everything is going to be ok.
Everything is going to be alright.
Everything is moving forward still.

***Cry, Cry, Cry* by Johnny Cash** 
(not exactly the meaning looking for)

<br>

## Smile ##
There's a reason to smile today. Appreciate the smiles you see from people. There's a reason to hope today. There's hope for everyone and what everyone is overcoming.

<br>

## The Seed Within ##
The seed within lays buried deep. It's deep within and grows it roots to spread out throughout the earth.

There's a seed underground.
These green plants and these flowers growing through the cracks.

<br>

## It's Not About Me ##
It's not about me.
It's about the girl next door kinder than me.
It's about the girl in class struggling more than me.
It's about me too.

It's not about me.
It's about everyone.
It's about my mom. It's about my grandmom.
It's about us, and it's on all of us.

It's not about me.
It's about him.
It's about me helping him.
It's not about me.
It's about him, and it's on us.

It's about all of us.
We're all helping each other.
It's on us, and it's about all of us.
We're all heping each other rise higher.
All of us rising stronger and wiser.

<br>


## This Experience ##
This is good for you. This experience is good for you.

<br>

## Your Enemy Is Your Friend ##
You thought you had an enemy. You really had a friend in disguise. You thought you were being laughed at. You really were being taught a powerful lesson. The light in the darkness, it's so strong and true. This experience is good for you.

<br>

## Independence ##
You can stand on your own two feet.
You can give it a whirl.
You can rise back up and forgive yourself.

<br>

## Rebel ##
The rebel flag, cowgirl boots, gun images
swirling in my head
These lies, they are dizzying
They cause such pain and anguish

Let's raise the banner
The time for the red white and blue and gold is here
It's might and strong
It give me hope

<br>

## The Airplane Lifts Up ##
The airplane lifts up.
I want to fly.
I want to see the aerial view.
I want to look down below and see all the land and and all the flickering lights.

Airplanes shooting in the sky
Trains of white trailing

<br>

## The Catch ##
It was such a catch.
He caught my eye.
Our song was a glimpse of the truth.
That he's not that bad after all.
And that I need to use my voice.

It was a catch.
He caught my heart.
Our song was a glimpse of the heart.
That the truth echoes out forever and forever.
And that I need to use my heart.

It was a catch.
He caught my soul.
Our song was a glimpse of the real.
That life is for everyone.
And that I deserve reciprocation.

<br>

## The Lone Bird ##
There's a bird on the fence flying all alone.
She lifts here wings so gracfully.
How I'd like to be like this lone bird.
She's strong when alone and sails freely through the sky.

The lone bird flies high through the spring trees.
The lone bird sits still on the ground.
The lone bird sails gracefully on the yellow driving sign.
The lone bird rests on a walking sign.
The lone bird launches and lands onto a brown tree branch. 
The lone bird flutters with the wind amongst the green leaves.
The lone bird rises high in the sky.
The lone bird perches on the electric wire.
The lone bird mounts on the street sign.
The lone bird glides with the wind.
The lone bird pecks at the lead. 
The lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground.
The lone red bird finds her spot on a machine outside.
The lone blue jay stands on a fence.
The lone bird explores her freedom.
The lone bird finds her support on the power line.
The lone bird scurries through the grass.
The lone grey bird expands her wings.
The lone bird swoops down to hover the river.
The lone bird feathers her wings above the water.
The big lone bird stands on the grass near the farm holding her poise.
The lone bird skates on the ice.
The shadow of the lone bird is beautiful in the grass.
The bird alone on the city map, she knows her city and she loves the water.
The lone bird knows her place on the wire.

## The Church Bells ##
The church bells are ringing.
You can hear them through the universe.
In this kissing of the hearts I hear the bells echoing out from you to me and through to the church.
In this oneness with a love so deep I feel this sacredness within.

Churches everywhere, trees relecting through windows

**Ring Them Bells *by Sarah Jarosz***

<br>

## Night Hours ##
Night hours.
When you can't fully see.
There's the light in the darkness, saying "I can trust in you."
The flickering lights. They are everywhere like the fairie dust.
You don't know what's on the other side, but something is there to greet you with love, a surprise, the answer that was there all along.
The crickets, the creeking of the railroad in the dark evening night.
A window into the light.

City lights.
A hard day at work is done.
The lights at night are on.
The day is done.
The night is on.
The people have left work.
The light supports their action.
It's loud and silent at the same time.

<br>

## Stars ##
All these stars in the midnight sky
They glisten and glow
They grow and glitter
They are crystal clear
They are the yellow-white silence of the night
With the cars driving by, the zooms on the highway, and the crickets singing and hummingtheir songs, the stars are white, graceful, a symphony, a dance, a waltz in the sky.

How you are more than brilliant
They know their names and yours.
They sit still up there.
They sparkle.
They guide me, they guide me to the light, to your glory, to your beauty.
They remind me of the peace, and the reason to live.

Stars dancing through the universe
Echoing out
Sharing the love
Loving the earth

There's a whole world inside of you of thinks you love
There's an entire world out there waiting to be known

I love you like a star in the darkness of the night
I love you like a morning star ready to start the day
I hope to be with you both day and night

two singing, swinging stars, "you're amazing", "you're wonderful"
in concert, in synch with the universe

outside those prison walls, there's a universe of stars and flowers

there's an entire world inside you
that you think about and love
that you want to know engage with, understand, and believe in prayer for 
there's an entire world you live in
Imagine what is in the world

Wonderful people, stars wonder
you are all kinds of wonderful

You're the one that I love
You're the one that's true

Day in and day out
Like a star in the night sky
Winking and twinkling
I sure do love you

You make me stronger
You make me better
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I love

With you in my heart I will always be living
You're the one that I want
You're the one that's true

I'm crossin my heart and hopin to die

<br>

## Green Earth ##
Green earth, brown seeds, brown dirt
Blue, white, turquoise sea

<br>

## Storm ##
The silence just before the storm
The howl of the wind

After the storm when the leaves are wet
the branches have fallen
the power went out
It's ok to dream again about a life filled with color
the beauty is everywhere
there's always a gift, a blessing in disguise after the storm

the droplets after the storm
earth's teardrops saying it's ok, "I'm here"

There's beauty everywhere
There's sun shining through the puddles, the droplets rippling over everywhere

<br>

## Past and Future ##
The past fading away like a river
The future running toward you with a plan like a mountain 

<br>

## Leaves ##
The leaves, the brown and yellow with branches
The green moss on benches
The water droplets on grass and the table like islands and continents
A map formed on a table by water droplets

<br>

## Fighting for Her Independence ##
Through the fight for her independence, there is ground beneath her feet.
Trust, love, and joy sings through the depths of her soul, and through her light, all the colors on the Earth feel embraced.

She lets go of the claims.
She lets go of the ugliness.
She lets go of the uncultured and uneducated beast.
She lets go of the envy.
She lets go of the weakness.

She lets the true strength and true light-heartedness reign within.
With each new day under the Sun, she opens her heart to more independence, love, and innocence that can shine through the land that belongs to everyone.

Everyone needs a reminder sometimes
I am born to love, born to be free, born to love and be loved in return

<br>

## Hey Lovely Woman ##
Hey lovely woman

You're free to be you

## Hey Man ##
Hey honey, you're amazing.

You know how to reach my heart.
I feel you tuning in.
You're so on point every time.

<br>

## It's Not a Love Triangle ##
It's not a love triangle.
She's not your babe.
She's the girl you're supposed to know.
She's the girl you're supposed to love.
She's the girl who will help you grow in ways you never knew you should.
She's that girl on the outskirts who knows how to help you when you've fallen.
She's fallen too so don't worry she needs help getting back up.

<br>

## Hey Strong Man ##
Hey strong man
You are amazing
You've got it all going
You really know what to do
You are lovely and caring
You dare to be the best
The whole universe surrounds you

You pump others up
You're the coolest man there is to know
You got it all
You have no need to compete
You are the best of who you are

<br>

## His Hands ##
His hands are running into the ground.
He's got a hold of all four corners of the universe.
He's been down these roads.
He's blazed these trails.
They are for all to find.
He wants them known.

## Dare to Achieve ##
Dare to achieve.
Dare to rise up again stronger than you were.
Dare to push the boundaries.
Dare to love harder than ever.
Dare to meet new people.
Dare to shift the thought forward.
Dare to accomplish everything envisioned and dreamed.
Dare to stop doing what is harmful.

<br>

## The Freerider ##
She's a woman who can stand on her own two feet.
She knows how to straddle a horse alone,
block and tackle like a true innovator,
and pull her self up by the bootstraps like an entrepreneur.
She may have made mistakes in the past,
but there's a golden light in her heart freed from the chains of people's opinions and the internalized oppressor.
She may feel held back from understanding herself and expressing herself, but she can gain dominion over her heart.
So much freedom is there for her ahead.
There's a gigantic frontier of possibilities and internal peace.
She's a lover of knowledge, and true education with a home full of books and art.
She has a heart for people that forgives and sings.
A true woman she is, expressing ladylike qualities and poise like a true Queen indeed.

<br>

## Falling Under ##
Falling under, falling under all the mistakes.
Wanting to bury oneself in the ground.
Wanting to dig a greater hole.
Hiding for the shameful things done.
In this moment, there's a choice to live another day.
There's a choice to lift oneself up.
Let life carry through.
Meet the demands of the day.
See the sun rise.

Falling under all of the regrets.
You can't go back in time.

digging these heels into the ground
digging a hole deeper and fruther
running on rocks
stepping on stones
running through dirt, the clay
getting clay stuck on the bottom of these shoes
falling to rock bottom and shoving it down
shoving it down into the earth
it's not mine

giving the dirty heel
hitting rock bottom
hitting the ground
pulling the trigger
bouncing back up higher
a criminal, not a bride
I learned too 'not to play with guns' and seriously put them down

Falling hard to the ground
Turn my sin to dus
Bury this shame
Take me to where the air is clearer
Digging in my heels and making it worse

<br>


## Let It Crash ##
Let it crash.
Let it fully crash.
Let it crash.
Let the waves crash.
Then rise back up to meet the tide.

The crashing washes it out.
The cleansing is in the crash.
The crash supports the moment to begin again, and receive the help.

The crash is the dirt moving out with the purifying waters.
The irritants flesh out.
The cleansing salt water is found.

There's a way.
The ocean is always moving.
The water is always stirring.
The storm will die down.

All these dumb things I've done.
All these dumb things I've said.
I want to throw it in the dirt.
I want to rewind the clock.
Love is not a fool.

<br>

## Moment of Death ##
At this moment of death, life is beginning.
There's so much more to know.
There's a whole world to know.
There's so much more love to see.

At this moment of falling, the chance to love more is beginning.
There's so much to appreciate differently.
There's a world of people to love.

The moment of death is the moment to start afresh.
It's ok to feel sorry, confused, hurt, hopeful, and dancing all at once.
Everything is going to be ok.
Everything is going to be alright.
Everything is moving forward.

The moment of the biggest fall is the moment of the highest bounce.
It's ok to feel angry, bitter, happy, and curious all at once.
Everything will work out in the end.
Everything is in order.
Everything is going to be ok.

<br>

## Life is What You Make It ##
Life is what you make it.
All the voices echoing out at once, reflecting the same truth.
A symphony of voices around me all relying on the same Truth but speaking different words
An echo of voices in heaven sounds like heaven

<br>

## Falling to Pieces ##
Falling to pieces.
A world surrounded by idols, people you are not supposed to know.
Kicking and screaming in a world surrounded by people you're not supposed to know.
They've got it all going.
I'm going crazy.
They take the lead.
I am spinning off them.
A world full of idols.
It's like broken glass..
Torn leaves.
Branches fallen off from the tree.
Leaves in puddles.
The storm is so loud in a world full of idols.
Water droplets on the grass.
Water droplets on the leaves.
Sunken leaves.

<br>

## Droplets After Rain ##
After the rain is over and through,
the raindrops are on the window

Water droplets, water dropelts everywhere

on the window the shape of them
earth's tears on the window

the sky just found relief
it let out its feelings
I hug the sky and say thank you for the cloud's relief
thank you for your feelings
and thank you for the sunlight drying out the water droplets

as the rain lifts and the storms stops, the colors shine through to smile through the Earth

<br>

## It Was All A Dream ##
It was all a dream.
It was all a dream in a little girl's heart wanting to be someone.
She watched all the other girls having fun and being free.
She was the one on the outskirts.
It was all a dream not for her. 
It crashed down, and she grew up.

<br>

## The Devil ##
The devil's got a hold on you.
Every time you find freedom you want to fight back.
Striking back.
Hitting back.
The trigger within.

Stomp on the devil.
Bury it in the ground.
The devil on your shoulder

<br>

## Lugging The Weight ##
Lugging this weight around, dont want to be here feeling

<br>

## Who You Are ##
It's funny when people try to tell you who you are

<br>

## Red Dirt ##
The red dirt reflected through the water.
The red dirt tracks.
The red dirt on the side of the road.
The gold-yellow haystack needles.
The yellow brown dirt on the road.
The smell of fresh grass.

<br>

## Bandwagon ##
Jumping on the bandwagon to this glory road.

<br>

## Bottles with Dirt ##
These leftover water bottles with dirt
Left on the side of the road
Dirt mud and muck in them
Bootleggers left on the side of the road on a rocky dirt road

A waterbottle left on the side of the road
construction hats on rooftops
leftover waterbottles
dirt roads

<br>

## Cracked Roads ##
These cracked roads.
This red dirt.
It reminds me of the end of the world, the beginning of time, when all returns to dust, and it all begins anew, fresh.
With a breath through the universe, it all begins, saying or speaking "I love you".

The road is good, it leads back home, high heaven
Life is a journey that started at home, and ends at home
Life is a journey that leads closer to oneself
Life is a journey that leads to an expanded self
Life is a journey with interests, hope, stories, progress
Step by step
Destination by destination
The path, the trail is marked
Leaving behind love, lessons, hurt, pain
The next step, the next destination has already been paved, it has already been through
People cross paths
Some meant to stay
Others meant for a lesson

<br>

## Summer Rain ##
Summer rain
The grey clouds overhead
It's pouring
It's time to run

<br>

## Footprints and Leaf Prints ##
Footprints and leaf prints in the sidewalk
The footprints have paved the way

<br>

## Cracks ##
Cracks in the earth that go back to the beginning of time and show what we are made of.

A red rose, a red flower with green leaves peeping out of the cracks showing the beginning of time.

<br>

## Rocky Road ##
It's been a rocky road
a rough start
painful memories
overcoming

<br>

## Chasing ##
Chasing for nothing.
Chasing for the love within.
Chasing for the memories from the past.
Chasing to live a good day today.
Chasing for the best inside of you so we can get along, so you can get along.
Chasing to be understood.
Chasing for the freedom to move.

<br>

## Stumbling and Falling ##
He strikes out of the blue
You won't know he's coming until he's come

She hits without a warning
You won't see her approaching until she targets

Stumbling and falling and getting back up
Losing control and finding the peace

Running around and finding that it all fits together

Playing the fool
Running around crazy
Doing dumb things
Doing what you know you shouldn't do
Crashing down

<br>

## Regrets ##
Regrets.
Things done wrong.
You can't go back.
You can only go forward.
Time only moves forward.
Positive memories from the past can relived.
Lessons can be learned.
Think something new.
Do something different.
Rear view mirror vs. Front window

<br>

## Lost in the Mess ##
Lost in all the mess of this weary world.
This wearly world has been living for ages.
Where does this old soul of my go in a dried-out world?
Things are begging for my attention.
All I'm seeking for is rest.

<br>

## All These Things I've Done Wrong ##
All these things I've done wrong, I lay them on the ground.
They've been eating up my soul.
I do my best to learn and move on.

<br>

## I Am Looking For You ##
I am looking for you.
You are looking for me.
I vaguely know you in another world.
You already know how to reach me.
I can feel your spirit running through the earth somewhere already.
You can feel me and my heart beating and repenting.
I know you're out there somewhere.
I am here too becoming who I am destined to be.
It's a match made in heaven.
It's mutual and reciprocal.
It's already there.
It's something within.
It has extended since the beginning of time.

<br>

## What I Want ##
I want to know you without words being spoken.
I want to love you in the peace and quiet.
I want to feel like it's true love on the other side of the Earth.
I want to see through the window to your Soul.
I want to see through different eyes.

<br>

## Partnership ##
You and I, helping each other to help the world.
Looking at each other to see what each other love about the world around us.
Lifting each other up.
Helping each other grow.
Working through the changing seasons.
Navigating the dark side of life.
I look to you know how to be better.
You look to me to know how to be better.
We create a part of the world and help the world create a better one.

the ups and downs
the waxes and wanes
the laughs and the cries
There's a lifetime ahead of us

From season to seaon
I love you through and through
Winter and spring
Summer and fall
Like a red red rose and green grass popping up in the harshness of the rocky earth
I love you with all my heart
I cross my heart and hope to die

the green popping up through the dirt, the rocks
it's the test of all time
the good soil

The church bells are rining
for you and for me
It's a heart to heart kiss
It's an eternal embrace

This love never burns out
It's a continuous thing
The flame is forever bright
It goes on and on and on

<br>

## This Love ##
This love goes back.
It goes back to a time before you and me.
It goes back to a time when roses bloomed through the cracks, and the family tree was being conceived.

There's a love so big.
It was born with the stars before you and me.
It loved before the writing was on the wall.
It's so big, and it goes back. It embraces the whole sky above.

This love goes back.
It goes way back, and it's a love that's huge.
It fills all of our hearts.

## Trees and Roots  ##
Look how high the trees go. Wouldn't it be great to soar that high, and lift up like the branches?

Look how far the roots spread. Wouldn't it be great to go so deep, and be that strong?

<br> 

## Kiss on the Heart ##
A kiss on the heart, a heart to heart kiss
It ties our hearts in a knot and entwines the two of us into one
The heart knows all
Our hearts become one
I love all that you love, you love all that I love

When our two hearts meet, there's a fusion of love that reaches all the world
When we hug, everyone can feel it

There's a golden thread that let me to you and you to me
There's a golden thread tying a knot between our hearts weaving your life together with mine
Bringing us together
Connecting us together
This golden thread has been everywhere
and you are the man for me
Leading all the steps towards you I took make you better and all the steps you took towards me make me better
The golden thread linking all my stepping stones
Running on stones with you

## Someone Out There ##
There is someone out there for everyone
What a beauty is in the match made in heaven
The dream pair
Destined for each other

<br>

## Rain ##
Dancing in the rain
Water droplets falling
Hitting the cement
Morning glories falling also
Hitting my head
Without this rainfall we wouldn't have this 
luscious green earth
nurturing the land

<br>

## Stepping on Stones ##
I want to step on stones with you to old age
reaching milestones
measuring a lifetime
Measure a lifetime through
Seize the true world and what it has to offer

I want to run through life with you
I want to step on stones
I want every step along the way to lead us closer to our destiny
I want to reach God's glory of heaven with you

<br>

## I Want to Live Life With You ##
I want to live life with you
a good lifetime with you
a lifetime of days
a lifetime of smiles
a lifetime of seasons
a lifetime of adventures

<br>

## A Messenger Bird ##
A messenger bird came my way to show how TN was the west, TN is my home
The land, the eagle, the golden halo 

<br>

## Hand Holding ##
I want to feel the warmth of your hands
I want to feel the blood running through your veins to your finger tips
I want to feel you alive and well
I want to feel the love running through your hands and body
I want to feel your heart light up with what you love
I want my brain to spark when I hear you speak about interesting things
From your feet to your head I want to feel us alive and well

He grabbed and held her hand
I wanna feel the warmth of your love
The blood rushing through
I'm living by moments with you
The moments with the love between our hearts filling it up

<br>

## Over It ##
Over it.
It has nothing to do with me or them anymore.
It's done.
I've moved on.
I am different.
They have their place.

<br>

## One in the Family ##
You are one of the family
People come along to teach us lessons and show us more about families
You are one of the family
You remind me of people I know

<br>

## I Am Looking For You ##
I am looking for you.
You are looking for me.
I vaguely know you in another world.
You already know how to reach me.
I can feel your spirit.
You can feel me.
I know you're out there somewhere.
I am here too becoming who I am destined to be.
It's a match made in heaven.
It's mutual and reciprocal.
It's already there.
It's something within.
It has extended since the beginning of time.

<br>

## To You I Will Always Return ##
To you I will always return.
To me you will always return as the reason to live.
There's a world to explore.
There's a home to build.

<br>

## What's Yours is Mine ##
What's your is mine.
What's mine is yours.
It belongs to the earth.
It belongs to our eyes.
What you can see I can see.
What I can see you can see.
It's the same world.
It's the same idea.
What you can hear I can hear.
What I can hear you can hear.
It's the same unvierse.
It's the same planet.

<br>

## Home ##
This home of mine.
It's been here all along.
The ancestors have been calling down, singing down from heaven, awakening me from up above to what life is all about.
The wind has been calling my name.

Circling around this place called home again.
All the memories from the past come alive.
They unearth themselves and revive a sense of childlike wonder so deep.
So much good has happened, and so much good is waiting to be born again.

This is old sweet home.
You hold a space for me and welcome me with a hug.
The place where I can always be welcomed and always return.

This home where I'm from.
It's all made new.
Im made new.
People are new.

This old sweet home here down in the south
where everyone knows each other
and everyone's connected
the deep south
the summer sounds
the family meals
the back porch
the cheerful parties
th laughing
the screens

<br>

## Home ##
Home, a living system that starts within and expands out.
Love for one another, love for all the people that one another touch, love for what another share interest in.

## Weaving In and Out ##
Weaving in and out.
At one with the giving and the receiving of the aid.
In union with the recipient of the help.
A coincidence in what is being overcome.
A sharing of hearts to meet mutually the end goal.
A trust in the progress of mankind and the harmony of the universe.

<br>

## Eyes ##
The eyes, the window to one's self.
They share a good laugh, and a smile.
They speak one's history that goes back to before time existed.

<br>

## First Impressions, and Expressions ##
First impressions, they don't capture the whole story.
People warn, "you can't judge a book by its cover."
The full expression is there, and the intuition is given to draw out the entire expression.
The expression digs deeply into the earth through the roots that tap into the ground and touch the water.
Second looks, second glances, diving deeper to see the fuller picture, and the details are really what she loves.

<br>

## "Boys Will Be Boys" and Mistakes ##
They say 'boys will be boys' and 'boys make mistakes', but I have made mistakes also and said and done dumb things.
It's ok.
It's tough.
Things happen.
Get back up to live another day.
Learn from the mistake.
Become a better person.
Start fresh.
Do something new.

<br>

## Coming Around the Bend ##
Coming around the bend, returning home to where you belong.

<br>

## Hey Friend, Let's Share a Good Laugh ##
Hey old friend, it's you again.
I love to see you.
I remember all the things done wrong though.
And sometimes I just have to have a good laugh after things go wrong.
Hey friend, let's share some comic relief.
After all that..
It's going to be ok.
It will be ok in the end.

<br>

## These Feelings Are Universal ##
These feelings are universal.
The feeling captured in the song are ones everyone has.
Thank you for the musician who put the feelings in words.
I am glad to realize I am not the only one.

<br>

## The Music ##
It reminded me of my grandmother's heart, my grandfather's music playing, my great grandfather's lumber business, my great grandmother's piano teaching, my aunts' and uncles' greetings, my neighbor's style, my uncle's sense of humor, my mom's Christmas Cards, my dad's radio station, my old music list, and my cousins' lifestyles.

<br>

## Same Roads, New View ##
These roads I have driven down before, but I see everything - the people, the homes - everything in a new light.
Everything grows richer, deeper, fuller, and more alive. I see the beauty, not the poverty.

The road is good, it leads back home, high heaven
Life is a journey that started at home, and ends at home
Life is a journey with interests, hope, stories, progress
Step by step
Destination by destination
The path, the trail is marked
Leaving behind love, lessons, hurt, pain
The next step, the next destination has already been paved, it has already been through
People cross paths
Some meant to stay
Others meant for a lesson

<br>

## Looking Deeper, Looking Wider ##
Looking deeper, looking wider, I find my home, and the truth within
I find the place where everyone, everything is interconnected
where bad memories are replaced, new pictures captured

<br>

## Expanding Continously ##
Expanding continously
Forever raidating out
Like the Truth echoing out
The things that resonate continue to resonate

<br>

## Swirling Leaves ##
Yellow leaves swirling around above the side walk.

<br>

## All of Life is a Church, School, Democracy ##
All through out the Earth, there is a Church I am walking through.
We are walking in a gigantic church.
All of the world is a church.
I am walking through a gigantic church.

All throughout the Earth, there is a School I am walking through.
We are walking in a gigantic school.
All of the world is a school.

All throughout the Earth, there is a Democracy I am walking through.
We are walking in a gigantic demcoracy.
All of the world is a democracy.
I am walking through a gigantic democracy.

<br>

## Praying on the Road ##
In the car, on the road is the best place to pray.
Following the rules of the road, the logic of the street, the signs and signals.
Engaging in conversations, and meeting people at truck stops and gas stations.
Meeting people on the street, who are asking for help is a democratic thing.
The space where freedom meets rules.

<br>

## Angels Are Everywhere ##
I felt some angel wings.
I saw a feather.
I saw an angel note on a poster on the side of the road.
I heard a song on angels outside of a church.
I heard the birds chirping when I returned home.
Angels are in songs waking us up to our reality.
Angels are everywhere.

I hear angels in the whisper of the wind,
the smile of a friend,
the rustle of the leaves,
the advice from a stranger,
the sympathy of a colleague,
the hugs from a practitioner,
the sharing of accounts with a neighbor.

<br>

## Yes, WE Can ##
I had been in a dark place for so long.
I was expressing revenge.
I left so many hateful comments.
I could not believe in myself.
I hated playing music.

And then...something came to life inside me.
My prayer I said for myself - "Yes, I can; Yes, We can" worked.
I picked up my guitar, and I played a little tune.
It felt so good to feel at home within my heart.
It felt so good to feel able and free.
We live in America Reborn.

Someone once said "the amateur builds the ark."
The professionals heal, but nothing can stop the amateur from trying it out too.

It's never too late to try something new.
It's never too late to be reborn.
It's never too late to rediscover the depths of your home.
It's never too late to reawaken to your ancestry.
It's never too late to think a new thought.

What a beautiful earth it is, and what a beautiful child of God there is down deep.
There are reasons to stay alive, indeed.
Anything can be healed.
It's natural.
Yes, we can build a new earth, a new heaven, and restore the land from the ground up, from the South to the North, from the East to the West, from the States to the Sea, from the Sea to the Continents.
Yes, we can. It's called Pangaea. It's called "the one tribe" that we can believe in again and again again after a severe backlash, and a severe breakdown.

<br>

## God Reminded Me of a Prayer I Said in the Past ##
God reminded me of a prayer I said in the past.
He heard my prayer. He heard my plea.
I knew I did a good job.
He reminded me that "YES, I CAN", "SI, SE PUEDE", "TODAY IS A NEW DAY" "I CAN WALK FREELY WITH THE LORD."

God whispers with the "still, small voice" in the darkest hours when you need a subtle reminder.
"Yes, we can."
"Yes, we can."
"Yes, we can."
He speaks to the prophets, the listeners of Martin Luther King, Jr. the voice of the "I AM US, YOU ARE ME, I AM YOU".

<br>

## Damn Lord, You Did a Good Job ##
It's a new day that has yet to begun, and I already want it to end.
I feel like I have failed.
I feel like trash.
Everyone knows what I've done wrong.

There are failure stories on my left.
There are success stories on my right.
I take up the failure stories, and admit to the wrongs.
I take up the success stories, and thank God for creating me and helping me to overcome.
'Praise the Lord for creating me', I say, with a winning smile on my face. The success stories are just that - 'Christ the King living and moving and breathing right on through me'.
Damn, Lord. You did a good job. You helped me to forgive. You helped me to bounce back up. And you helped me to reform. You helped me to survive.

## A New Day ##
It's a new day.
Open your window to the sunlight.
Take a deep breath and smile.
Welcome humanity, and the world into your heart with love.
Close the door to peering into the lives of others.
Trust they are right where they are meant to be.

<br>

## A New Day ##
It is a new day, the fan is blowing, the water is running, the sound of silence plays in the background.
I made mistakes, reacted out of anger yesterday, yet again.
The sun is dawning on a new day, and I can choose to reform, and let go.
The sun is shining on the Earth from a new angle, shedding new perspectives on things.

<br>

## Musical Chairs ##
Trading places
Shifting views

<br>

## Day In and Day Out ##
This life is on repeat. 
Day in and day out.
It's another day for more of the same.
There's the mundane and the pain.
There's the joys and the laughs.
This life is on repeat.

Day in and day out.
I'm circling through this world.
What goes in comes out.
It's another day for the wash.
There's heartbreak and misery.
There's surprises and fun.
This life is on repeat.

Day in and day out.
I return to you.
I return to the things I love.
I remember why I live.
I return to the ways I can improve.
There's nonstop growth ahead.
There's always a work in progress.
Day in and day out.
It continues forever.

<br>

## Days of the Week ##
Monday mornings, it's a fresh start
It's a fresh start, it's time to begin again
It's time to arise, it's time to go to work

It's a Saturday, it's a day for laying around, reading a book, laying on the couch, taking a nap
It's a day for looking out the window and seeing a spiderweb

It's a Sunday
It's a day for peace, for life, for activities and fun
It's a day for picnics
It's a day for dancing in the streets
It's a day for neighborhood parties
It's a day for the sun to shine down
It's a day for a hike
It's the day before the week starts, begins again
The day for rest, peace, community, family, lunch

<br>

## Two Sides ##
There's two or more sides to the same story
No one knows it all
No one has the full picture
Being brought together to be part of the story unfolding
Sometimes two people mean the same thing while saying different things

<br>

<br>

## A Face in My Dreams ##
I remember this face on the other side of the world speaking to me in my sleep, smiling to me in a dream, and waking me up to life.
It came to me in a vision, a vision swirling in my head.
It was so vivid, it was so real.
I could see the bright eyes, the mysterious gaze to the other side of the universe, and the whole face.
She was with other people.
She was dancing and twirling around.
She was smiling a mysterious smile.
SHe was creating a life.
She was making crafts.

The smile through the earth as one 

<br>

## A Space Without WOrds ##
A space without words
The beauty in the silence
The grace in disguise
The time to sit and be still
The time to reflect
The space to appreciate a smile, a heart-to-heart, a hand
The time to hear your heart
The love that is quiet
The peace within
The calm

<br>

## There's Another Side ##

You help me see a side of me that I love.
I see a deeper side of you I love.
I can see through to a part of you that cares.

You know also through the thick of it I care for you so.
There's more to me I can learn about.

There's more to you to come to life.
It is great to see this waken up.

Thank you for being my friend.
Thank you for lighting me up.
Thank you for pushing me to change.

THe light shining down, it returns to wholeness

It takes faith to wake up another day.
It takes faith to walk out the door.

It takes faith to forgive and heal a relationship.
It takes faith to move on and trust people.

It takes faith to keep going with joy.
It takes faith to heal fully.
It takes faith to trust people.

It takes faith to love fully.
It takes faith to keep going an extra mile.

Everyone has faith.
Everyone with a heart has faith.

<br>

## A Long Road ##
There's a long road ahead.
The road goes on and on into the horizon with yellow lines down the middle.
It's uncertain where it's heading.
I set my head straight with a vision.
I hope to move through with love and hope.

There's a long road ahead.
I hope to move through committed.
There are new views and new jobs.
There are old buildings to resurrect and re-appreciate.
There are old songs to sing.
There are new colors to paint with.

<br>

## The Side Roads ##
The side roads that lead to new surprises and destinations I love.
You don't know where they are going.
They beg you to question what's down them.
They ask you to explore and walk down an unknown path.
They call you to see something different and go on a detour.
Through the orange gates, across the white fence.

The road is good, it leads back home, high heaven
Life is a journey that started at home, and ends at home
Life is a journey with interests, hope, stories, progress
Step by step
Destination by destination
The path, the trail is marked
Leaving behind love, lessons, hurt, pain

Down these side roads, I discover something.

<br>

## If I Had Not Done This...Reasoning ##
If I had not...then ...

<br>

## Where I am weak, you are strong ##
Where I am weak, you are strong.
Where I am broken, you are whole.
Where I am alone, you are there.

You are already part of my family. 
You remind me of people I already know.
This love continues for ever and never stops.
It expands forever with all of humanity growing as well.
It loves you to the moon and back.
And dances with the stars after you are dead.
It picks you up when you fall.
And forgives you when you've failed.
It remembers everything true at heart about you.
And synchronizes with you.
It knows you with all your full glory and colors.
It knows how to guide and protect you.
It nudges you always to the right intuitions and ideas.
It sees the light in you when darkness and discord are all around.

<br>

Rhythm, harmony, synchronizing, weaving, sailing, gliding
In, and out, moving

two candles burning
two rays of sun

## Highway ##
She is a highway girl.
She loves to pray when she drives.
She loves all the cars moving around in symphony.
She loves her thought that moves slowly.
She has the freedom to process information.
She can hear the beauty of the sounds.
She can open her eyes to new people in roadside hotels and at gas stations.
She can cherish the order and harmony of all the cars driving together through mid-day traffic.

<br>

## Gone With the Wind, She Universally and the Wind ##
Gone with the wind to the hurts of the past.
The past moves behind her as the wind blows.

Into the future with the wind that knows her name.
The wind calls her home and points her to where she always belonged.

The wind sings it's song and knows how to still her heart.
The wind returns her to where she always once was.

The wind is the breath that has been there forever the same.
It sweeps through to show her how the seasons change.

She runs fast with the wind as it shows her what she needs to know.
With the wind that rushes through the whole earth at once, she feels it bring her home.
 
With the wind and the breeze, the leaves fall off the tree, and sprinkle and dance and spin around in the air.
The wind blowing my hair. The breeze hitting my neck.
The wind, the breeze blowing the leaves

<br>

## Hand on My Heart ##
I put my hand on my heart in a nation with two sides of the same coin. The dots all connect. The puzzle pieces all fit. THe 50 states all fit with lines and shapes and rules and boundaries and highways.

We all live in the same world. We all want to be someone to someone else. The present was there yesterday and the present will be there tomorrow. I'm moving forward through life to see what I could not see in the past. The script is flipped to show the other side to the story. The script is always being flipped. Driving down the highway I see the fuller picture that was always there and the fuller picture that was always developing. Looking thorugh the rear view mirror to learn the lesson but looking thorugh the window to see what's in full view.

I put my hand on my heart for the red, white, and blue.
I put my hand on my heart for the stars and the stripes.

It's the native land.
It's a land of many.
It's a country created by trailblazers.
It's a country of discovers and explorers.

I see what's common in my neighbor's eyes.

It's a tale of two sides both fighting for freedom.

*It's a grand old flag, it's a high flying flag*
Nothing like that good old flag waving on old porches and construction sites

It's a union where there's two sides to the same story, the same whole.

I love these beautiful people.
I care to be strong and true.
I love this land until I die.
I love the red white and blue.
I love the golden thread.
I love this land for eternity.
It's roots are strong.
It's rivers run deep.
It's mountains run wide.
It's hills run wide.
This land is for many.
I am one voice in many.
There's a country of people who love this land too.
The red white and blue is for me and for you.
The stars.

My dad always shared stories of how the country would not be what it is until the old rebel flag is put down

My hand on my heart
American flag
ideas and notes in the book
250 years

My hand on my heart and think of all the people in the land
what a beautiful world
it's been here fore 250 years
I think of all that this country and these people can become
There are ideas that have always existed

Home of the free, home of the brave
The women behind the election

I put my hand on my heart and love the land that I am in.
It's the land of the free, and it's the home of the brave.the home of the free, the home of the brave
It's a brilliant land
It's a hopeful land
It's a faithful land
It's an abundant land
It's a beautiful land
It's a prosperous land
It's a courageous land
It's a native land
It's an inclusive land

I put my had on my heart and love the dear old American flag
How I love the shining stars and the stripes
The red white and blue

all 50 states
the nation's leaders
thesurrounding blue seas
the red and white stripes
the father of light 
the land of good soil
the good going on

Old Glory sacred symbol, flag
Symbol to pledge
America, a new constellation
A land of twinkling lights, burning hearts
Stars, individual stars
the Earth, the mother
Liberty's crown of stars
horizon to horizon
it's written in the stars
our names are up above
it's a country we are destined for
a nation where people can be born new
triumph on land and sea
Victory, Triumph, Victorioius, Triumphant
the destiny, guiding stars
Serving the good for all, the highest supreme good
A great nation
Father of lights, goodness
Common mission
glowing hearts
names written in the sky
we've fought for our independence
the rockets have gone up
Wave it proud, wave it well
 
**"the primary builder of their nation was divine nd that their nation's blueprint was heavenly" "new nation" (p. 18, Inventing the American Flag book)**

<br>

## Harmony in the Universe ##
There's harmony in the universe that reaches to the sky filled with stars and back
It reaches the church with its bells ringing and back to the heart, the home within
United by love
I love you with this echoing truth that reaches the depths of the earth and the universe

<br>

## Stories Passed Down ##
All these stories passed down through words shared in a song.
It's a family story.
It's not just about me.
It's about everyone around me.
It's about all I hold dear to my heart.
It's about what everyone around me holds dear to their hearts.
These stories passed down, these lessons learned last and echo down.

So many other people share these types of stories and lessons echoing down though.

It's like the rippling of water in the lake, the pond.

One drop ripples out.
One story is part of my stories rippling out, echoing out, and harmonizing.

A song can lead to a new song, and a new song can lead to a new question, and a new question can lead to a new book to read, and a new book to read can lead to a new view.

<br>

## Climb Back Up ##
You can climb back up.
You can start over from the bottom.
You can begin again afresh after ending miserably.
When one ladder moves, there's another ladder to climb.

You can find another route.
You can find side roads and detours.
You can take a turn for the best after taking a turn for the worst.
You can see the world with different eyes after being blindsided.

You can take a step back.
You can return to where you started.
You 
You can always take a step back after moving two steps too fast.
There's a full picture to see and there's an aerial view.
You can reutrn to where you started when you've gone too far out.
You can return to whrere you were it's time to go back out.

You can always find a different mountain.
It's waiting for you to walk up.
It's the land you belong to.
You can find the world there.

## He Was One of Those Guys ##
He was one of those guys that knows how to make you smile. He walks a mile in another's shoes. He sees through someone else's eyes. He will hear your needs before they ask. He will know just how to reach someone.

His eyes are so deep they see to the heart.

He lights up the whole town
He shares a good laugh
He tells good stories
He tells good jokes

<br>

## Wisdom Tree ##
Idea of a wisdom tree
All the stories of people on the wisdom tree
Stories they've learned 
The stories of old people
I want to be on the wisdom tree with you like two leaves that transform over and over
Year after year
Season after season
All the colors
 
All the notes left by people on the wisdom tree
Words of wisdom from people around the world around the school

Everything in your life my life waiting to die is like the dead leaves falling off the tree
The foliage is the change
There is love everywhere
It's fall
Leaves everywhere
It's like dancing in the rain but better
There's a nw school year ahead
Orange leaves amidst the green ones
 
Everything is being born new.
Those dead leaves have fallen off and moved on.
They are giving way for something to grow.
It's a new season.

<br>

## His Eyes ##
His eyes can see through the whole wide world and see so much to love.
His arms stretch out to those who need it.
He's got the big picture in his heart.

He knows just where you are.
He steps over stones to get you to where you need to be.

 <br>

I gave myself away

Knotted yarn balls
Scratched lines on mirrors
Crinkled up peices of notebook paper

# Creative Writing - Independent Writing #
# Spiritual Experiences #

## The Shift ##
The shift was in realizing more deeply the work people do day to day, the every day jobs, the singing and the dancing through the every day jobs. 

<br>

## The Same Thing through the Spirit, Different Forms ##
Doing the same thing through the spirit in a different form.

<br>

 ## God Never Fails ##
Just when you feel like you/I have failed, God moves in a miraculous way through a vision, a song, an insight, a friendly neighbor, a job, an act of forgiveness.
God is always bringing us closer to our family, first individually, and then collectively.

<br>

## Love, the All-in-All ##
Love, the all-in-all
The light bounces off
The darkness cannot touch it because so much light is bouncing off of light, and so much gratitude is bouncing off of gratitude, and so much love is bouncing off of love

<br>


## The Story of the Puzzle ##
With life as a puzzle piece, everyone has a place.

## A Childlike Home ##
A childlike heart rings true
It continues on and on in upward ways
Seeing the world with different eyes, new colors
Feeling restored
Sharing a hug, a picture
Coming back home
Coming back to where I always belonged
Circling back
Returning

The road is good, it leads back home, high heaven
Life is a journey that started at home, and ends at home
Life is a journey with interests, hope, stories, progress
Step by step
Destination by destination
The path, the trail is marked
Leaving behind love, lessons, hurt, pain

Back where I began

<br>

## Smile #
Smile like the noonday sun.
The glow on your face.

<br>

## Insight ##
Healing is different from coping. 
Healing is God restoring every cell in your brain and body.
Coping is compensating, covering up, worrying about everything wrong, and overcoming.
Healing is remembering one's childlike self, and true self.
Healing is being honest with oneself.

<br>

## The Correct Prayer ##
The correct prayer is 'Shepherd, Show me how to love'
'how to love as God loves'
'through the darkness'
I love to shift my perception to see people as God's daughters and sons

<br>

## Unconditional Love ##
Even after I've done something wrong, I can feel the love within.
It's coming up for me to love all of those around me.
Anything else is worry, and human judgment.
I can drop this, and walk freely with the Lord, and the Love within.

<br>

## God Stills the Storm ##
God stills the storm, literally and figuratively, holds the rain off, lets man worship with the Sun shining, and causes the rainbow to peek through after the rain.

<br>

## A System of Ideas ##
'You, oh God, are the source and circumference of being.
Thank you God, that you work through us individually as distinct ideas.
Thank you God, for knowing where each idea needs to be to bless, uplift, and be a healing influence.
Thank you, God, for your system of ideas. We abide in you, you abide in us. What blesses one, blesses all.'

The idea that one shares sparks an idea for another to appreciate and share.
That idea that another appreciates and shares motivates an idea for someone else to work with.
There's a system of ideas, constantly moving, constantly inspiring, constantly renewing, and remembering, and constantly uplifting.

<br>

## Confidence ##
'with faith'...'in God'
Being so one with God that one can be happy for all of those around you.

Being so rooted in God that there's a knowledge that God's idea is fit somewhere.
Being free from the pull to compare or judge or feel judged.

<br>

## The Harmony of True Business ##
"Union in its highest meaning is the universal union of God and man, divine Principle and idea. True management, since God is infinite must be God's absolute government of His perfect, spiritual universe, including man. Mary Baker Eddy unites in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (p. 209), 'Mind supreme over all with its formations and governing them all, is the central sun of His own systems of ideas, the Life"

"I stand in union with you.
I am in union with everyone I meet.
We meet in the spirit of compassion, the letting go of evil beliefs, and the desire to grow together to become more loving, more whole, and more unified.
I have made similar mistakes as you.
I have succeeded in ways similar to you.
We move in union with all of humanity at once."

<br>

## Speak Gently ##
"Speak gently!
It is better far to rule by love, than fear
Speak gently, let not harsh words mar
The good we might do here!

Speak gently!
Love doth whisper low
The vows that true hearts bind;
And gently Friendhip's accents flow;
Affector's voice is kind.

Speak gently to the little child!
It's love be sure to gain
Teach it in accents soft and mild.
It may not long remain."

<br>

## Silence the Waves ##
Silence the waves, 
oh my soul
oh my soul
you are my source of peace
when the fear and the rage
kick and scream
God is always still there

Thank you God for your Son
the one who stilled all so well.

<br>

## A Poem for a Marriage, a Wedding ##
In your weddedness to God,
your union eternal exists
in a house undivided.

In weddedness to God,
I am grateful to share
happiness with Mary for 
3 generations of Furr women.

What blesses one blesses all,
so the union can only bless everyone.

<br>


## Weddedness to the Earth ##
I am wedded to the earth
In all it's glory and all its inhabitants

In the light of eternity, I walk with you
Wedded to the whole wide earth with all the colors, the folowers, the trees, and all of the people
Walking equally withe veryone with a purpose

<br>

## The Love, and The Goodness within vs. Society and Culture ##
Man, and Woman are dependent on Love.
Love moves us to appreciate one another.
Love moves us to smile at each other.
Love moves us to forgive, and share a good laugh.
Love moves us to pause, and stop reacting.
Love moves us to apologize.
Love moves us to understand someone who is different, and really listen.

<br>

## Mortal Mind and Divine Mind ##
Mortal mind wants to assert itself through fear, through judgment, through offense, through threat.
Divine Mind asserts itself through peace, through compassion, through empathy, through understanding, through patience, through prayer.
Mortal mind wants to control through pressure, through anger, through manipulation, through jealousy.
Divine Mind wants to control through morality, through the consciousness of good, through helpfulness, through good character.

<br>

----------


## The Shadow Side ##
"Yea, though I walk through the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me for all the rest of the days of my life."
This is the shadow side to who you are. There's a gentle soul beneath it all, waiting to unfold into greatness, and ready to smile at all of the humanity and all of the human race. There's a heart waiting to sing in the post office and the laundry room.
It's amazing, and beautiful how God led his people out of slavery. It's not God's purpose for man to be enslaved. God leads his people through the wilderness.

<br>

## Words Cannot Express ##
Words cannot express the deep things of God.
Awareness of the Christ is key to healing.
God moves people with compassion to discover the Christ expressed in everyone.

<br>

Forgiveness, returning to the original, the point of origin, the home, where all are welcome, trusted, brethren, sharing happiness, sharing the same Father-Mother.

<br>

## The Healing ##
The healing is there; it's already within.
There's nothing to change; just the true ideas welling up within to ressurect and live.

<br>

## "What Beauty There Is In Silence" ##
"What beauty there is in silence".
In silence, there's true strength with no one telling her to find her strength.
In silence, there's knowledge without words.
In silence, there's space to muse.
In silence, there's the reality of someone's heart beating without any verbal communication.
In silence, there's space to stand aghast at and laugh at the ways people push people over, silence people, and ridicule people over quietude.
In silence, there's space to appreciate the mystery of it all, and enjoy the interconnectedness of Life.
In silence, there's the opportunity to say no to the silent arguments masquerading through my thought.
In silence, there's a grace.

<br>

## "Love Chases the Storms Away"
Love and life within chases the storms away.
After the storm, the tree branches lie on the ground.
The leaves have fallen, and the rain has gone away.
The sun reflects through the puddles on the ground.
The water evaporates in the sun that shines.
The residue from the storms falls way.
Life continues with freshness.
The light of love and life chases the storm away, leaving no room for negativity, and only gives room for rebirth and renewal.

<br>

## Your Job ##
Your job is an attitude towards life, and an outlook towards the world and humanity.
Your job is not confined by your job title, your social status, your place.
Your place is in the land of the divine, where ideas in your heart continuously unfold, and are not limited by the job or opinion of others.

A world not centered around me but centered around my neighbor's eyes: filter, perspective, viewpoint

<br>

## Present, Past ##

It's your divine right to be free, whole, singing, healed, joyful, purposeful, employed.

<br>

## Morality ##
Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of good, and doing good, where there exists only the righteous thoughts, not the thoughts of want. Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of joy, and being joyful, where there exists only the desire to see the light in others and be grateful and happy for them. Is the act life-giving? Then it's morally right. Is the act loving? Then it's morally just. Is the act truthful, honest, factual, and just? Then it's morally correct.
Is the act principled, ordered, and balanced? Then it's moral. The place within where there's moral freedom is where there's a consciousness so filled with love and light, and no room for fear, anger, false judgment, want, or disappointment.

<br>

## Right Desire vs. Wrong Desire ##
Like produces like.

What is in desire will lead to an action.

A right desire leads to love, better ethics, spirited growth in grace, new understanding, new ways of seeing the world.

What is a wrong desire?
A wrong desire leads to frustration, roadblocks, anger, and strife.

<br>

## Harmony the Real, Discord the Unreal ##
God harmonizes everything. Harmony is the real, discord is the unreal. God knows what I need to learn, how I need to gain a new insight, and how I need to understand something. God knows what to draw out of his people. God is never mocked, and God is never making fun of people.

<br>

## What is My Motive? ##
To love someone new today.
To move beyond my comfort zone.
To include all of humanity in prayer.
To understand someone who needs help.
To express patience in my thought.
To see from a different angle.
To shift a habit.
To demonstrate order and cleanliness.

<br>

**A Poem on Healing**
The feeling of healing is being restored to one's true self, what's already there, and what's waiting to be born and discovered.
Dependent solely on the movement of God's love and God's word that speaks through intuition.
The real, substantive thoughts already lay hidden behind the surface of false beliefs.
The golden reality within is waiting to be awakened, unearthed, unhidden, and mined.
One's wholeness is innate, in tact, and always there.

**A Poem on Prayer for Humanity**

<br>

## Religious Liberty ##
Christian Science embraces all religions, all churches, all races, and all of humanity.
The Christian Science church architecture roots itself in Romanesque architecture.
America does too. America was founded with a love for religious freedom and religious liberty, though there are debates over what this means to people.
The architecture in Charlottesville was rooted in Roman architecture.
I love all the churches, I love all the people, and I love that God forgives everyone and speaks to everyone.

<br>

## Roots ##
You can claim what you were born to be.
Your roots may have dried out, but your roots run deeply into the ground.
Dig within deeply, remove the weeds, and discover the glory.
The glory, the beauty, the soul of Soul is there.

<br>

## Home and Music ##
Home is where it all begins.
There's a place for music and you all in my heart forever.
Childlike memories of light, dancing, and merriment last forever.
No hurt can reach the child within, we all express this sweet, childlike innocence.

<br>

## Healing, It Starts at Home ##
"'Twas Love Who Traced a Bow of Promise on the Cloud"
The Full Promise Came

Healing, it starts at home
with life and love
It expands out into the community that
unfolds forever and ever
in love, one remain
Thank you for your structure, and overlapping spheres, oh Lord,
You maintain our spheres as the stars that shine
Thank you, God, for always being with us.

<br>

## Constant Evolution ##
There is a constant story of being, evolution of thought, revolution of light, rebirthing of man, and renewal of color.

<br>

## I am Whole ##
Dropping the narrative that I have made a mistake. Taking on the narrative that I am whole. God's way is higher than my way. And "all works together for good" when seeking to understand, desiring to progress, yearning to improve, going within to love more, working to apologize, asking to learn, working to perceive correctly in the light.

<br>

## Eternity is a Concept ##
"Eternity" is a concept that can be expresed through different ways, and can mean broader and higher things relating to time, place, and mankind.

Collective sunrise, and collective sunset

<br>

## People are Good ##
People are good.
Your people are everywhere, "Oh Lord".

<br>

## Culture, Soul ##
Culture is rooted in Soul. Music is Soul. Culture Wars. There is no culture war in Soul.

<br>

## Healing from Abuse, both the Abused and the Abuser ##
There was no reason to be jealous.
You have it all within, sister.
The qualities are there. The latent talent is there.
You may blossom differently or later, but sister, you spring from the same source, and the ideas are there.
So love your brother, and love your sister. Love must go before you, and you are not estranged.
Sometimes the night must be taken back, the fight within must stop, and the time to be receptive must come.
God does amazing work through the pain, and really opens us up to Her living reality.

Hey sister, I have a lot in common with you
There are moments when I am not graceful, and I want to feel jealous
You seem so superior to me
You look like you have it all
I have a lot going also
No one needs to be picture perfect
Just one day at a time recognize the goodness within

Who doesn't love their brown-haired sisters?

<br>

## The Goal of Healing ##
The goal is to alleviate the pain and suffering.
Heal it.
Make it whole.
Restore it.
Clear it.
Wash it away.
Love it.
It's a system.
It is a whole system.
We are all aiming otwards the same goal.
We are all looking for salvation, freedom, safety.

<br>

## Hope ##
There's always reason to hope.
There's always reason to see something new.
There's always something new to learn.
There's always another angle.
There's always a deepr view.

## "Penny for Your Thoughts" ##
"Penny for your thoughts is an idiom"

<br>

## A Note for Years from Now ##
Today I write this note and I toss it into the sea.
I toss it into the sea and hope that in 50 years I look back to see all that was going on today expand.
I hope that in 50 years I cna look back to all the yesterdays and see how they turned into today.
I hope that I can see how all the tomorrow's turned into this day in 50 years from now.
Everything expands.

<br>

## The Ripple Effect ##
He throws a coin into the pool of water.
Plop. Plip. Tlop.
The coin causes the water to ripple.
One ripple continues to ripple outwardly into other ripples.
An outflowing of water rippling and flowing.

<br>

## The Ripple Effect ##
When I look into your heart and love you I love all the people you love also, the love ripples out endlessly.

When I create a spin off of something you have created, the creation ripples out endlessly.

<br>

## Circling Back ##
Circling back through time.
Unwinding the clock.
Turning to pen and paper.

<br>

## Words of Wisdom ##
The older I grow the more I learn and the more I realize I did not create this world.
The older I grow the humbler I become.
Once in college before reaching a breaking point, I had read "Frankenstein" and reached an epiphany: "Am I my own god and creator?"
No, something created me.
This was the beginning of the destruction of the ego, the false self.
I was humbled, humiliated, and through rising back up out of the ashes, I discovered more of who God is and how God lives and moves through me, and supports me.

<br>

## Into the Sky, Into the Ocean, Into the Green ##
Into the sky, upward into the 3pm afternoon sky, the clear blue air.
Into the depth of the ocean, across the sea, into the depth of the gray-blue waves.
Into the green through the brown-grounded forest and up the mount to see the land below.

<br>

## Shattered Glass ##
It's another step away from the past.
The past is fading behind like shattered glass.
You can look through the shattered glass and see the brokenness and leave it behind.
You can look through the shattered glass and see the positive memories beneath it.

<br>

## The Edge ##
Reaching the edge of death
the edge of time
the edge of the universe when the past crumbles away
There's a new beginning
to understand more
to start over

<br>

## Tide ##
The roll of the tide, where the sea meets the land.

<br>

## We All
We all look to the same Truth.
We all radiate out from the center.
Beliefs, opinions are like colors on the spectrum.
We all aim to look towards the same Truth.
A world of shapes and colors, patterns and textures.
We all appreciate the same flowers and leaves.

<br>

## Flickering Lights ##
The flickering lights-
The flickering lights or gold balls in the hearts of all the people throughout the nation and the earth.
The flickering lights in the homes and office buildings united.
The flickering lights in the night sky that reach other galaxies.
You can see them from up above in the plane looking down through the seat window.
You can see them while walking around through the city.
A society run by electric lines, power grids, and lightbulbs.
The flickering light reflected thorugh the water.
The flickering light in the middle of sea.
A window into the light

City lights.
A hard day at work is done.
The lights at night are on.
The day is done.
The night is on.
The people have left work.
The light supports their action.
It's loud and silent at the same time.
All the rooms twinkle like the stars in the night sky.

**1950s- rural electrification, paved roads**
Currents, water, electric

<br>

## Taking Back the Night ##
Flying into the night sky, I take back the night, where in reality it is a silent night.
I sing with the stars above, where everyone has a place, and the world around works like a symphony.
In the depth of the darkness of the night, the light shines through the window, and the stars glitter and shine, lighting the path.
I know I am held so tightly because of how brightly the light shines.

<br>

## Sprouting Up ##
An idea from within sprouts up. It starts as a small seed of intuition reminding someone of something latent, a memory of the past, a story in the family. Cultivating a love for this small seed lets it grow into a greater reality. It grows and grows into its full self. The idea from within the home that's already there becomes a full garden, a full way of being.

<br>

## What You Water Grows ##
What you water grows. What you express gratitude for expands.

<br>

## The Darkness ##
In the dark, when I am all alone.
The light flashing through the car in front of me can't scare me.
The light within guiding me with intelligence, peace, security is so strong as the light flashing through the car.

<br>

## A Romantic Vision ##
A rose, a flower blossoming through the wintery blast, the darkness of the night.

<br>

## The Sound of Silence ##
The sound of silence is so grand, so great, so beautiful.
In the silence, I can hear the greatest music, the greatest song of all.
In the silence, I feel the leaves, the rain, the sun, the breeze, the road, the trucks, the goodness of all the people on both side of politics.
I made myself vulnerable, started opening up, felt guilt and then shame, and then embarassment, then violent, and then angry.
I opened up in the wrong way.
There was silence, no response, feelings of inferiority. I fell, and stooped so low in violence.
I rose up higher with a bounce in my step, a love for someone else, and a resilient sense of being.
I tried to apologize, I saw more deeply, learned grander lessons, and felt the true sound of silence in my own heart rather than the sound of silence coming from someone not accepting of me reaching out.
Every heart is so beautiful, and I know this true sound of silence is within everyone's heart, but the false beliefs, the dark clouds cover the true sound of silence.

<br>

## The Rose Within ##
There is a rose within everyone's heart.
It must be watered, it must be nourished.
The love is strong, and the light is bright, even at night. It is all one with all of humanity.
Nothing is as beautiful as a red rose in the harsh, blasts of a winter storm.

A rose in the valley in the desert of my heart looking for true love for hope for water
It's coming up to bloom
It's like the flower peeoping up out of the gravel road with grass all around it
It's as perennial as the grey rock that covers the Earth
It's here for life
it's here for love
It's lasts for eternity
There's a golden light around this rose in the desert of my heart here to light up everything
It loves in the dirt, the red dirt
It touches every heart spreading roses through the valley
There's a rose here for me and for you
It grows in the mud

the plants, the rose, the green leaves
they have been here for eternity, since the beginning of time
they know the earth's, the world's language is love
the rocks, the dirt

<br>

## Rose Petals ##
Rose petals dropped on the floor.
A sweet surprise.
A message from love.
A symbol of love.
A warm embrace from a stranger, a friend who let them drop.

<br>

## A Circular World ##
A circular world we are living in.
New people born day in and day out.
Other people finding heaven day in and day out.
One door closes, another door opens.
One chapter ends, another chapter begins.
It's constantly unfolding.
The sun sets on one side of the earth, the sun rises on the other side of the earth.
It's constantly rotating.
Exiting one stage, entering a new stage.
Leaving one era, entering a new one.
It's constantly spinning.
All is made new.
Trash thrown way, new products born.
It's constantly recycling.


Every day a light bulb turns off and a light bulb turns on.
Every day something is thrown out, and something is reborn or recreated.

Turn on the light, and the answer is there.
Flip the script, and the whole is in place.
Shift the perspective, and there is something fitting underneath.

<br>

## The Airplane ##
The airplane is launching.
It's going up and up.
It's lifting higher and higher.
It's taking everyone with it.

<br>

## Bloodstain ##
Red bloodstains on a white counter

<br>

## The Coins ##
The four coins sitting on the grounds.
Whose are they?
Where have they been?
Who are they for next?
They are shiny silver and bronze.

<br>
## Leaves ##
A red leaf on the ground turning to crumbling pieces in a pocket, falling to the ground.

<br>

## City Sounds and Visions ##
Kids yelling at the pool.
Lunch orders called.
Doors slamming.
Birds calling.
People eating and smiling.
Fan running.

These old city sounds -
the truck running,
the neighborhood pool yelling,
the machines beeping,
the train whistles,
the tic toccing of tools,
the cars zooming,
the summer bike rides,
the letters in the mail,
the greetings of postal workers and mailman,
the riverview loft views

## Summer ##
Splashes
Sandcastles
Messages in the sky
Hammocks
Porch swings
Ice cream
Peanuts
Gas stations

an old town summer night
the air hot and sticky
the crickets
the hot dogs and hamburgers
<br>

# A Year #

## A Year ##
12 months per year,
4 season per year (in some parts of the world not 4),
A season for everything (the Bible),
365 days per year,
Winter, Spring, Summer Fall,
Bare branches glistening gray,
Snow covered trees,
Flowers blooming,
Snow covered flower buds,
Fully blossomed trees,
Green, brown, hot barren fields,
Water droplets on green leaves,
Orange, yellow, red, and brown foliage,
Leaves falling,
Everything in a year coming full circle.
The changing seasons, transitions, metamorphisis, one thing becoming another thing
A constant adaptation, a constant shifting, a predictable movement

An earth, a sphere,
It's green, brown, blue, and white,
It rotates around the sun 365 days per year,
There's sea and there's land,
Humanity circles around it,
There are 7.2 billion different perspectives,
There are ## countries, 
There are ## nationalities,

You and me - we live under the same Sun that the earth, the sphere rotates around,
It shines on us from different angles,
It lights us up in different ways,
It warms our faces equally in different seasons,
365 days per year,
Imagine all the people we live with sharing smiles, a laugh, an exchange, forgiveness while looking up to this same Sun,
Seeing a friend in everyone, loving everyone's view.

Collective sunrise and collective sunset

It's always rotating, always shifting
See new things, discover new things

Every day, the perspective the perception shifts of the world
The world shifts like the earth rotates
The sun was always there

Year by year

The wind knows my name.
The people are growing, takig on different, higher views in the same brown earth.
Seasons change, and there's a season for everything.

Cycles round and around, year after year.

The waltz of the universe
the meeting and greeting of

Another spin, dance, trip around the sun (a year)

A world not centered around me but centered around my neighbor's eyes: filter, perspective, viewpoint
The world evolves, the sun still shines like love still shines through after a great fall

The sun is the center
The rays of light radiate out
The hearts filled with love radiate out from the central heart of hearts

Day in, day out, the earth continues to move

The day meets the night, the night the day

Worldview

Another year lighter, humbler, stronger, more conscious, aware, knowledgeable, and filled with love
How the sunlight shines in and grows brighter and then dims

1 degree closer to the sun, the love you're seeking everyday
Around and around and around this earth goes
 
<br>


----------

All the languages of the earth
The number of people on the earth
The number of continents
The number of countries
The number of languages
The daily actions, small actions
Another year lighter, humbler, stronger, more conscious, aware, knowledgeable, and filled with love
How the sunlight shines in and grows brighter and then dims

**Interested in refining this.**

## A World ##
A world
constantly changing
Beliefs shifting
A place revisited with the eyes of a child
People occupy places, attitudes, positions
Contributing their perception, interpretation, perspective

A world
constantly shifting
Based on perception, interpretation, perspective, and movement
We all live on this same earth that is circling around and around year after year, day after day, growing, flourishing

Another year lighter, humbler, stronger, more conscious, aware, knowledgeable, and filled with love
How the sunlight shines in and grows brighter and then dims

<br>

## Universal "You and Me" ##
You, across the street, and me are looking at the same sun right now

The World would resound with light and sound.
The World where the heavens, the sky smile down.
All the colors of the universe are embraced as one.
--All the coordinates, every localized place, people look up to the same Sun from different perspectives.
For 365 days a year, the Sun lights up the Earth like the love that lights up our hearts.
People sing with their full hearts and sing their own tunes.
I love that 7.2 billion people on Earth look to the same seas from different places, thinking of one another.

Collective sunrise and collective sunset
The face of the earth, all the faces

Year after year
widening, broadening, deepening, growing, learning, understanding, relearning, fading

Imagine all 7.2 billion people saying "I cross my heart and hope to die" with a vision of all the voices echoing out the truth and smiling through the earth as one with forgiveness, redeeming grace, love
Imagine eternity and haven for all 7.2 billion people. Think of all 7.2 billion people as eternal ideas.

Imagine all 7.2 billion people echoing out the truth in their own ways but resounding in harmony.
Imagine reaching the mountain heights.
 
 live through the changing seasons
 explore the earth
 synch, rhythm, sail, soar
 from the great heat, sandy seashells and sandcastles to the falling leaves and orange, gold, yellow, and green to glistening brown trees with snow falling down to the pink flowers blossoming with an occasional rainfall back around again to heat with green leaves everywhere

<br>

Two people in the same world
Meeting heart-to-heart in the same world
Two worlds apart on different sides of the same one
Coming together to heal

The world is a place
 
<br>

## To the Core ##
Connected, at one with the core of the Earth, the center of the Earth, the heart of the Earth.
In step and in sync with everyone around, moving as one.

<br>

## Strangers ##
I am a friend of many.
There are strangers walking all around.
They are my friends.
I look them in the eyes.
I see familiar people all around.
I see the depth, the light, the ancient soul.
All across the earth, people walking.

<br>
 
## What's a World without Love? Born to Love ##
What's a world without love?
Central sun
Seeing through someone else's eyes
Born to love
Born to love someone today

# Mothering and Pregnancy #

## Mothering ##
Forming new memories, starting a fresh, new insights, new ways of seeing things, new ways of being come to me like a mom
watching a newborn baby learning how to see the world each day freshly and naturally.

<br>

## Pregnancy ##
It feels weird to me that
another human body can grow out of a woman's body
...But really there's a science to this.
Physicial connection grows out of love and trust, and a spiritual connection.
Walking around with another being in your body looks weird to me.
...But some people think it looks beautiful.
...And doing that requires love and trust.

In reality, people exist in Christ, in God, we find our strength,
All the right ideas grow out of everyone.

Beyond physical reproduction,
there is spiritual renewal
through spiritualization of thought, and letting go of falsehood.

<br>

## Benevolent Sexism ##
Women idolized in certain spaces
Masculinity - guitar, suits

## The Sea ##
Today I filled a bottle with water and bubbles.

## Wishing Well ##
Today I found a penny on the ground
I gave it to my neighbors and wished them well.

I threw it in the pool and wished my friends well.

Be at peace with the universef

## Crushed like Grapes ##
"Crushed like grapes"

<br>

## White Flowers, Dandelions, Sprinkling out Through the Field, The Earth's Birthday ##
The world spins round and round
The earth is another year older
These flowers spread out
"The white floaties originate from a densely packed seed head that resembles a fuzzy ball. If you look closely, each seed head has dozens of umbrella-like extensions. Located at the seed head's center are the seeds -- each seed has this umbrella structure attached to them."
 "As you saw in the timelapse, once the flower head has matured, it closes up and the withered flowers contract into a bud-like shape and fall away, leaving just the tufty white parts called pappi, which will help wind disperse the dandelion fruits or cypsela."
The leaves spin around in a whirl
The flowers you blow and wish with on another birthday
Another year older
Another year lighter
Another year lovelier 
Another year connected
Another year more youthful
Another year singing
Another year dancing
Another year connected to the earth
Another year holier
Another year more graceful
Another year more filled with love
It was a wild year
 
<br>
 
## Coins ##
Today I found a handful of coins.
I threw them in the wishing well.
I made a wish for you.
I made a wish that you feel the love.
I made a wish that I can speak and sing.
*"In ancient times, coins and the copper ensured infenctious-clear water."
a penny for the ripple effect of something
a penny for the stars to shine for eternity
a penny for kindness in school
a penny for the South to live on
a penny for the people looking for change
a penny for a smile on my parents' face
a penny for my sister and brother
a penny for the people's freedom
a penny for the couple's harmony
a penny for a love for a neighbor

A handful of coins I found in the side of the car.
I picked them up and held them in my hand for you and me.
You and me.
We can go out and dance and run with them.
You and me.
We can go out and spend money on ice cream and games.
We can go out and share a "penny for our thoughts".
The world is open to you and me to spend our money and bless the world.

He found me a five dollar bill.
A five dollar bill he found on the ground.

He picked them up for me so I can have some fun.
I can go out and dance and skip.
Just me alone.
I can go out and spend money on books and cars.
The world is open for me to spend my money and bless the world.

2 quarters.
6 dimes.
2 buckles.
4 pennies.

I wish well that girl who that guy goes out with and I hurt
I wish well that guy who tried to get under my skin
I wish well that guy looking for help on the side of the road
I wish well my partner for life
 
Family harmony
Rainbow in the sky

<br>

 ## The Penny ##
He found a penny on the ground and gave it to a friend.
'Penny for your thoughts,' he said.
He was interested in her thoughts.
He handed over the coin, and she said with a smile 'sometimes love awakens and love moves mountains and love reunites.'
Then she threw the penny into the well and wished well the people on the earth.
'I hope they feel loved,' she says.
'I hope that boy all alone on the bus finds a friend.'
'I hope that girl smiles to a stranger.'
'I hope that mom finds the strength within to be herself.'
'I hope that man is ok with crying.'
'I hope that dad hugs his child.'
'I hope that woman finds her dreams met.'
'It's a beautiful world,' he said, 'thanks for your thougths, and thanks for your wishes.'
With a plop, the coin fell into the well with a plop and it touched the water, and the water rippled out.
This love ripples on and on and on.
The wishes ripple on and on and on.

'I want to spend every day with you'
'I want to spend every day in new ways with you'
'I want to learn all of life's lessons with you'
'I want to live to put our notes on the wisdom tree with all of the other notes from old couples'
 
There's a penny on the ground
I toss it up and throw it into the green trees and the bushes
The leaves turn gold

I wish for a better day
I wish for the love in a girl's heart to shine true

wishing well-
for the love that fills the earth
for the love that moves mountains

Stepping stones
Learning something from everyone I meet, everywhere I go

What feeds this moment feeds the next moment
What I choose to do right now feeds what I choose to do the next
What feeds today feeds tomorrow
Every encounter with someone is a stepping stone to a lesson in life

It's all a stepping stone to progress, to greater consciousness, to truth, to depth, to love, to understanding, to grace

It's all been done before

stepping on stones with you through life

An old woman from the other side of the earth smiling and weaving.

Seeds of hope and love

--I wonder what good you have to share with me.
--I wink back and wish you the best.

--This love is like a star twinkling at another star,
--sharing the light in the middle of the night,
--dancing with one another in the symphony of the night sky.

--Everyone can see you winking at me.
--They can see the start of a new friendship.
--It's like all the other stars in the sky sharing the light and love
--In a universal dance of peace, love, and joy.

We all see the stars and the tres and the birds from our individual places. 
A GPS point place.

There's a whole world inside you.
There's a whole galaxy inside you.
There's a whole map inside you.

Stars dancing through the universe
Echoing out
Sharing the love
Loving the earth

There's a whole world inside of you of things you love
There's an entire world out there waiting to be known

<br>

## The Gun Images ##
It started with a laugh and a small.
The pain and confusion turned into "too much", crying within, pain, a reaction, and then gun images to express the pain.
The light-hearted laugh and the smile could live no more.

Why the gun images?
Put the gun images down.
Drop them.
Why use them?
Isn't there so much joy and live and love in that person, those people? 
Life gets better from here.
Just live.
Choose to live another day.
Choose to learn.
Love that person wholly.

<br>

## I'm Being Mean ##
I'm being mean.
Yes, I know I'm being mean.
I have scars on my heart, so I'm being mean.
I'm saying the things people don't want to hear.
I'm saying the things that will destroy me in the end.
I'm being mean and making a scene.
I want people to know the pain.
I'm being mean.
It's tearing us all apart.
It's robbing us all of joy.
It's challenging us all to shift.
I'm being mean.
I let the society around jerk me around.
The impossible standards, the negative reviews, the mixed messages, the hate. They jerk me aroud.
I'm being mean, and I know it.

<br>

## After all That Work ##
After all that work I had done,
after all those thoughts I had thought,
It felt like a slap in the face for you to try to tell me who I was again,
and speak for me.
I have a voice.
I did good work.
You are not my benefactor.
Thank you.

<br>

## She ##
She had it all.
She was the babe.
She had the voice.
And she had the career.

I was a sinner.
I could barely speak or sing.
I was so flawed, so lacking, so desperate.
I was not the babe.

<br>

## The Tease ##
He only spoke when it was convenient.
He knew my deepest flaws.
He knew my worst fears.
He knew my loudest secrets.
He knew my strongest weak points.
He knew how to box me in.
He knew just how to strike a chord with all that was wrong with me and make me change, force me to change, force me to look in the mirror.
He knew my favorite childhood memories.

It's making me crazy.
I'm making a scene.
It's so funny to watch, it's so funny to ridicule and condemn.
I can't read between the lines.
I was falling for it.

<br>

I love how you know just how to light up the darkness when there's a need for a joke.
This god damn tease, it yanks at my heart.
This true love runs deeper than the surface, as deep as a river flowing from me to you.

<br>

## It Was Make Believe ##
It was make believe.
It wasn't you.
It wasn't me.
It was pretend.
It was fake.
It was pretense.
It was a mask.
It was imagined.
It was a tale as old as time.
It was a myth that goes back to the beginning of time.
It wasn't real.
It was a dream.

<br>

## A Real Man ##
A real man would say go for it, do it.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You have it all within.
I believe in you.
I see the good in you.
I know who you are down deep.

A real woman would say go for it, do it, it's yours.
There's something great and insightful reflected in you.
You have it all within, my friend.
I care for you.
I see the light in you.
I know who you are down deep.

<br>

## Truth or Dare ##
So… once I thought I was Queen Elizabeth I because I knew my mom was Queen of Cotton Carnival and I loved how she was an education and church reformer and I felt like I was playing cat and mouse with a guy who knew all about politics and then it came back full circle with a little Truth or Dare I went along, and played a little Truth or Dare Some people equate #TruthorDare as rape culture

Truth is…I dared to go along with the Truth or dare and tell this guy I had a crush on him he did not care 
I felt like... 
#IWasJustAFan 
#IWasJustAClient 
#IWasJustAnIntern 
then I discovered that the Truth is….people betray people and the Truth is….I threatened to kill people…over Church Bullying, the South, and the Confederacy 
The Truth is…I discovered that my ancestors were the Confidante to Thomas Jefferson and discovered the Cumberland Gap, Plateau and I dared to kiss someone on the heart when feeling teased 
the Truth is…that the Truth echoes on and on, resounding forever throughout the universe, touching the ends of the earth, the roots of the ground, the depths of the home The Truth is…I love democratization 
Truth is...I used to dream of writing a book, and write a song, or incorporate history and culture into office design, but all I hear is

I am Racist, I am Entitled, I Can't Write, I am Unethical, I can't Sing, I am Reactive, I am Dull, I have Messed Up, I owe people something, or People will speak for me "She is ...."

Daring to suck
Willing to share the truth and nothing but the truth
 
Playing the fool and playing it well
Falling for someone who doesn't care
 
Confessing my heart and sharing my heart
Receiving nothing in return
 
Daring to suck and rising high after a fall
I am becoming who I am born to be
 
Daring to suck
I am not afraid of failing
I am willing to fail big
 
Falling hard for the trick but letting it be
Letting it be is all I can do
 
Going along with the tease and feeling the yank
My cup of love spills over and it spills out well
 
Daring to suck
It's ok to fail
I have failed big and I dare to succeed
 
 <br>
 
## These Feelings, The World ##
What do I do with these feelings?
These feelings, the rage, the spitefulness, the pain, the hurt, the betrayal, the desparity, the want, the lack, the displacement.
Someone on the other side of the world feels the same way. Someone in another city may also feel the same way.
We are one in the same, sharing the same feelings, experiencing the same things in two different ways, in two differen cultures.

<br>

## It's a Blue-Eyed, Blonde-Haired Thing ##
It's a blue-eyed, blonde-haired thing.
Don't we love our brown-haired, brown-eyed sisters though?

<br>

## Through the Silence ##
Through the silence, you knew to call out my name.
I felt like I already knew you.
I knew just what you needed.
We shared a smile and a laugh.
We shared a headnod and a walk.
We shared a song that brought back the memeories.
We shared some messages through the word wide dark net.

<br>

## Prison in My Own Home ##
Before the quarantine, I became a prisoner in my own home.
I felt like I was quarantined before the quarantine.
I felt like I was imprisoned before being imprisoned.
I felt like I was ostracized, yet connected before feeling close to losing it all.
I am compassionate, but I became something that I am not.f
<br>

## Bullying ##
Hello, Mr. Bully.
Remember me?
You were a bully.
You picked a fight.
You couldn't pronounce my name correctly.
You acted like I couldn't do my work properly.
Hello, Mr. Bully.
Remember me?
I visited your apartment?
...And you poked fun of me.
You treated me like I was stupid.
...Right in the center of your home.
You patronized me.
Hello, Mr. Bully.
Remember me?
I forgave you.
...But you denied me.
You put yourself on a pedestal.
You treated me like I asked for weird favors of you.
Hello. Mr. Bully.
You are part of a church with Celebrities.
And I am never enough, never competitive enough.
Thank you for provoking me.
I see all the selfies online.
I watch all the Celebrities.

...Don't worry.... I fought back. I retaliated. I sent images of guns. I became a bully back. I became passive aggressive out of anger. I started harassing people. 

...But Child, seriously... The correct approach is to stop the bullying, Let people speak up for themselves, Be more patient, observant, and considerate.

<br>

## The Same Metaphor, A Different Story ##
It's the same metaphor, but a different story.
It's the same culture, but different perspectives.
It's the same discovery, but different journeys.
It's the same world, but different places.
It's the same Sun, but different angles.
It's the same spectrum, but different colors.
It's the same Truth, but different standpoints.
It's the same Life, but different viewpoints.
It's the same system, but different tracks.
It's the same goal, but different skills.
It's the same country, but different backgrounds.
It's the same pattern, but different forms.
It's the same home, and the same meaning.
It's the same story, but different voices.
It's the same feelings, but different problems.
It's the same music, but different tones.
It's the same flowers, but different pieces of art.
It's the same world, but different languages.
It's the same art, but different expression.

--We are all weaving in and out and learning the same lessons.
We are all running to the same goal.
We are all aiming in the same direction.
It's like a river flowing.

<br>

## It's One in the Same ##
It's one in the same.
It's two sides of the same coin.

It's a union where there's two sides to the same story, the same whole.

<br>

## You Know Too Much About Me, You Spoke for Me ##
You know too much about who I am.
I heard my thoughts, and feelings captured through your voice.

<br>

## Too Good To Be True ##
You were too good to be true
You captured it all
It really struck a chord
You really knew my heart
You really knew my pain
You really knew it all
It really dug deep
It really led me to find my deepst self
It really led me to explore another side

You were so quick to know my deepest need
You knew just how to ease the pain
You knew how to make me laugh

<br>

## Singing Cowboys ##
It's mind-blowing that lyrics like those came to my thought before.
It's earth-sweeping that someone can capture the feelings I have yet to express through words.
There's a symmetry to life, and there's a resonance in the deep heart of hearts.

It's a blue-eyed, blonde-haired thing.
Don't we love our brown-haired, brown-eyed sisters?

<br>

## Alone ##
On the outside, looking in.
Expect someone on the inside to reach their voice, their hand out and invite them in.
The light refects through everyone.
Everyone reflects, sees, knows, and shares the light.

<br>

## Backhanded Complements ##
Those backhanded complements,
those snarky, side comments,
those spiteful poems,
those hateful emails,
those vengeful comments,
those cuss words,
those notes in the journal,
those rejection emails

They really sting,
they hurt so much,
they degrade,
they confuse,
they challenge thought to look at culture from different angles,
they encourage people to feel untouched and walk through the fire,
they exist on the dark web, in the deep corners of the universe, in the places where our hearts are most sensitive.

<br>

## Hitting Back ##
Why get back at those who hurt you?
Dwell in love where you're not hurt

<br>

## Babe ##
It's all about perception, motive, and intent.
"Babe" can be an innocent, endearing way to address someone.
"Babe" can also be a teasing way to address someone if there is no intent to commit and settle down with one individual.
"Babe" signals that the relationship is intimate, close, 1:1, so sound and innocent between partners, exclusive to people outside of the relationship, and questionable when used by someone who seems nebulous, not serious, or in relationships with multiple people.
"Babe", it can be innocent when coming from another woman also, like "hey dear".
It's all about perception, motive, and intent.
"Babe" sounds more sexual than "lady" or "woman".
People should hold themselves inwardly and outwardly like a "lady" or "woman", expressing "ladylike" and "womanly" qualities.
"Babe" indicates something sexual, which can be good in a relationship, like "you are cute", but it can degrade a sense of "ladilikeness", "womanliness", mutual respect and graciousness".

<br>

## The External and Internal Oppressor ##
People condemn resentment, and anger for oppression or bad treatment.
If someone is being patient for an extended period of time towards someone mistreating them, neglecting a part of who they are, undermining them, condescending them, patronizing them, or misunderstanding them, while they are forgiving them, the internal oppressor will seem like resentment with guilt, internal mockery, a sense of threat, self-hatred, and anger towards the ongoing enabling of negative behavior.
The internal oppressor is the external oppressor internalized.
The love from God shields man so that no form of human hatred can reach, and the love from God delivers man from this internal or external oppressor that leads to more aggression internally towards oneself or externally towards others.

<br>

## Healing from The Tendency to Fight ##
I want to fight back, react, send an email, kick a door, hit, or write a negative comment.
I want to manipulate the situation to meet my wants.
I want to yell out with anger and express rage to deal with the feelings of insecurity and inferiority.
I want to run away, hide, lay in bed all day, or withdraw.
And I have done these things...
...But I learn to pause...
I learn to think things through.
I learn to love more.
I learn to ask better questions.
I learn to apologize.
I learn to forgive.
I learn to see things from a different perspective.
I learn to resurrect.
I learn to exercise self-control.
I learn to write poetry.

<br>

## Healing from Weird Words ##
Oh my gosh!
Those words in all capital letters I sent.
Those hateful comments.
That jealous message.
Those awful reactions.
I am so sorry.

I know, it's so petty.
I was so hateful.
I was trying to seek revenge.
I felt so hurt, and so offended.
It's hard to take back.

Oh my gosh!
I was making fun of myself.
I was afraid of the bullying.
I felt so angry and so much of the weight and blame.

Thank you for forgiving me.

I am glad to write with more order, grace, and punctuality.

<br>

## Healing from Email Attacks ##

<br>

## Becoming Stronger ##
In the alienation and the doubt, your true identity becomes stronger.
Building yourself up in the time alone will help you learn to express good esteem in times of failure, hardship, and distress.
Every experience can help people to learn to think in new ways, explain the world more clearly, build onself from the inside-out, and trust one's conscience.

<br>

# Creative Writing - Independent Writing #
# Music Healing #
When in a healing, yet blurred relationship with someone, I remember listening to the song "When You Say Nothing At All". The song delved to the heart of it. Even though on the surface, there's a villain and a victim, a mouse and a cat, asking if "the cat's got your tongue?", the glow of the smile - the engimatic smile, the generity of the laugh, and the charm of the care speaks to the heart. 

From across the room, the silent heart-to-heart that cares and concerns, and knows intuitively the needs of another's voice and heart speaks. Is the care sincere? Is he laughing at me or with me? Is the love truly required, or is it a little Truth-or-Dare? The silence of a God-led heart-to-heart is for real and is as loud as the silence captured in the country song. The Truth-or-Dare feels like a prank, sinister, childish, aggressive, and insincere.

I also remember listening to the songs "As She's Walking Away" by the Zac Brown Band and "Hey Lady" by Thriving Ivory. The first song captures the idea of a God-led heart-to-heart speaking loudly with no words expressed in the room. The other song wasn't about me, but I could relate to the feeling of not wanting to burn my heart out on love and not wanting to lose someone before they walk away.

Finally, I remember listening to the song "Memphis Soul Song". There's an angel on one side, and a devil on the other side. An angelic woman caring, loving, and laughing with a devilish pull to want a boyfriend. An angelic thought in a man with a devilish side unmasked.

More recently I analyzed music lyrics on "boys will be boys" and kind, and sweet girls. I used to feel like I was the big-hearted, kind, sweet girl who followed all the rules, and treating guys like I would my cousins or brother to look beyond the societal mask; I began to make mistakes however, and I realized more deeply that guys are not the only ones who do dumb things - girls do dumb things as well, and in a way this is a good thing.

It came back up through another's song of the enigmatic smile, the victim and the truth-or-darer, the catcalls, the mesmeric teasing, the silence, the silent treatment, and the noise, the encouragement of men to love, the satire to point out vices, flaws, and the hidden things to be understood.

<br>
 
## Literature and Business ##
People write literature and poems and essays about experiences in shopping malls and stores. Good literature and poems, and essays, can also inspire how businesses design themselves. It's an economy driven by English literature.
 
Everything starts at home. At home, people write their stories. Outside of home, in the community, people can publish their stories. At home, life starts, and this life spreads out in the community. Everything in the community can lead back to home life, and everything in home life can spread out. It's a community, an economy driven by home.

## 2021 ##
This year, a dizzying year.
Everything this year felt like a blur at one point.
I have purged, and let go.
I have cleaned up.
I have continued to react.
I have helped Nate and people at the Salvation Army.
I have experienced shock. The shock came in September, August.
I went to the Discipleship Training.
It's a great catch to realize that the great state we call home used to be the West.
The internet is called the internet highway.
Peeping through windows into others lives.
Drove through Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, saw boots that look like cowboy boots but they are Southern, eastern versions of them
Harmonious action
Family reunion
Drove through Virginia, bad day, anger, reactions

The election results in 2016 shocked some people. It shocked me. Some people argue that the election results were an effect of miseducation in our country. I have felt miseducated. I read the biographies of President Barack Obama in 2021 while feeling sick, and angry.

My mom has compared me to President Obama before in the past because of how I speak.

The storm of women before a woman was elected President.
The women behind the election.
The women who have run for president before.

This is the city where the East meets the west.
It's home sweet home, and it will welcome me again and again.

<br>

## A Hairbrush on the Ground ##
Where has it been? Whose was it? Why is it on the ground? Imagine.

<br>

## The CTO of Your Home ##
Being the CTO of your house, your home.
Controlling your searches, your emails, your time online, your social media usage.
Being aware of the boundaries.

<br>

## Universals and Particulars ##
There are universal qualities of mankind, and there are particular qualities of mankind.
Mankind is musical universally, but some people are musicians, other people listen to music, some people play one instrument, other people play another instrument, some people like some kind of music, other people like other kinds, and there are particular filters in each heart through which someone can choose to creative music, feeling inspired by others and what is within.

Is music just for 1% or 99% or 100%?

When led to study data science, I did not feel comfortable with everything, but I drew from what I knew in Christian Science to learn about metaphysics.
Metaphysics in philosophy is different from metaphysics in Christian Science.
I remember finding it hard to understand the difference.
There is universal Truth, universal Faith, universal Spirit, universal Church, however, different churches, religious groups, faiths, schools, local places can be a conduit for particular forms of expression or pointing people to authenticity (like the Norton Hall Band, grandmama's faith, Mary's faith, people from Norfolk Academy, Jahan, people from EVERFI had particular faiths, Muslim faith, Atheist faith)

<br>

## Why Am I Being Tracked? ##
Why am I being tracked?
Why is someone viewing all my posts that I share?
Why is someone looking me up when I don't know them?
Why is someone knowing everything about me when I have never met them?
Why is someone using my information?

<br>

## Industry 2.0 ##
The white and brown trucks remind me of modern-day horse and buggy cars.

The internet is the new highway to Truth.
Anything and everything can be uncovered, discovered, and captured.
There's so much love, joy, happiness, beauty, and grace to share online.
There are so many words of wisdom to express.

Everyone interconnects online in the way the highway connected people in new ways.
New connections can be made, and old connections can be revived.
Be careful what you share. All the information moves so quickly. Some of it is advertisement, like the billboards on the side of the road, with an attention-seeking image, but no authentic response back.
There's a quick way to vent, compare, compete, or be exposed to things you may not want to be exposed to.

<br>

## Opening Up ##
Opening up to people about the negative thoughts, beliefs in the back of my thought, and things I should not say, feel, or believe. 
How do I work through these thoughts, beliefs, and things?
Opening up, feeling over-exposed, feeling naked, literally or metaphorically.
It leads to discomfort, something to shove down, or anger, and I express anger.
This is not true opening up. This opening up is the discarding of darkness to be transformed into light.

Opening up to the Holy Spirit, sense of joy, compassion, life, and childlikeness.
This spirit of man, born of the Holy Spirit, is within everyone.
It is reflected through the shadows in the back of people's thoughts, shining brighter than the shadows.
It is greater than the physical appearance of man.
Opening up to the sense of love within opens us up to people correctly to open up to the love within another.
Opening up to the light causes man's eyes to light up with a sparkle and a glow.
This is true opening up.

<br>

## It's a Southern Thing ##
The rural south seems insular.
Women seem less educated, and dependent on men.
People in the south seem racist.
The society around them expects them to work strictly in education and nursing.
The society around them expects them to become married and depend on men, and be less employed.
Women with blonde hair and blue eyes seem like damsels-in-distress, always smiling, and heartbreaking cowgirls, complaining about failure, rejection, and harassment.

Partly, I wanted to do a debut with an organization that waves a Confederate flag because I desired to belong, be accepted, and I desired the social status that my family had; but partly I felt like it was antiquated, and I was concerned for African Americans. The Confederate flag represents systematic racism, and I sought to understand political, cultural, and social nuances.

Martin Luther King, Jr. did not like organizations that raised Southern Belles, and I cared about healing from racism since I was a first year student in college. I carry prejudices towards African Americans still, but I remember participating in groups at a university with self-segregation with African Americans. After experiencing rejection and communication breakdowns in humanities classes, I starved myself for a semester because rejection from traditionally Southern groups is painful, but I reformed and engaged with people from more diverse groups and asked an African American man to my sorority date function. I also reformed in becoming less prejudiced towards the Caucasian race in the South, and appreciating their joy, innocence, and light-heartedness, qualities which I express also.

There are societal and cultural projections on African Americans. These societal projections can feel very loud, but black men are so intelligent, and free, and innocent, life-giving, and have good sense of humor.

At church, I feel like I was trying to break away from the pull to depend on men and the pull to fear the male-dominated workplace, I feel like I was trying to break away from the continuous search for a boyfriend or a husband, and be free from the cowboy-damsel-in-distress stereotypes, but somehow the claims became more aggressive.

<br>

## Quarantine - Regeneration ##
So much died, panicked, attacked, reacted in anger leading into the quarantine. There were so many riots. It was all like dead leaves on a tree losing its value, its integrity, its originality, its source of life. Even during the quarantine, riots, pain, frustration, anger, and attacks continued. So did the birth of new ideas awaken us, the regeneration of old, valuable ideas renew us, and the fading out of dead leaves clear our thoughts. The harshness of winter, when all is cold, bleak, lost, dark, angry, and fallen, giving way to a full-time spring, and summer. Flowers cannot bloom until the dead leaves fully fall off.

<br>

## Our Country ##
Everyone in our country are like stars shining on the American flag.
The light can't burn out.
The people are so innocent.
The water flows steadily through the channels, giving us peace and restoration.
Forever in the night, the stars do shine.
Our hearts burn.
Everyone in the country, everyone on the Earth has a light like the star that burns, and shines.
God holds us all amazingly in tact, in one grand brotherhood, and sisterhood.

Our country is home to all, including the red, white, and blue,
where we treat our enemies like brothers
find the light in the darkness
appreciate all the colors
we are all individual, distinct
contributing to the interdependence

Everyone in our country are like blades of grass.
Growing like a seed.
Becoming individual and original through the source breathing in through them.


## My Hand on My Heart ##
I put my hand on my heart and love this land.
This land is for everyone.
I'm putting the shadows behind.

The wind has echoed through for ages.
It's now speaking in a new way.
It hears our every need.

The land is more green than ever.
The lights in our hearts are brighter than ever.
What a land we all love with the golden red, white, and blue waving.

<br>

## The Union ##
North, South, East, West.
We all stand in this union, 
where everything is interconnected, 
rising above the conflict, the chaos, the discordant beliefs, and the enslavement and punishment of man,
finding our common bond, the bridge to the other side, and the joy to love a neighbor another day.

This is the place where the east meets the west, and the south meets the north.
This is the place where we all call home.
This is the place where we all appreciate the red, white, and blue.

From state to state I find the place to call home

<br>

## The South ##
What is in the South?
Friendly neighbors, strong families, lightness of heart, good food beautiful houses and architecture, and good porches.
Good music - bluegrass, country, the blues, and jazz, and bridges to the West Coast.
Equality.
A connection to the land.
A love of home and family.
Freedom from racial, gender, and cultural politics.
The place the country began and started.

I remember feeling some culture shock in Nashville.
I remember feeling uncomfortable with male practitioners and mostly comfortable with female practitioners in the past.
I remember I used to experience nervous laughter attacks.
I remember the signing up for class instruction.
I remember feeling intimidated by masculine imagery.

<br>

## Nashville ##
Shaken by the wind,
I discover the reality that is there
This is the state 
where the east meets the west
the north meets the south
and the south stays the best

<br>

## Southern Living ##
Front porch swinging.
People Laughing and singing.
Back doors slamming
Greetings and hellos
Neighbors everywhere
Sippin on tea and lemonade
Ants crawling and ladybugs out
The suns shining
I hear the shoes hitting the ground
I hear the kids yelling at the pool
I see the trucks driving by

<br>

## Sound ##
Sound is a part of mankind.
Everyone has a different sound or tone.
Sounds resound. Sounds affect. Sounds inspire. Sounds bounce off of sound. Sounds echo. Sound continues to sound. 
Sound has semantic meaning.

## Southern Titles ##
"Ladies" at home, and the country club, and "women" at work.
"Babygirl" and "babe" on the street, which sounds like a cat call after being raised to be a Southern lady.
Are ["ladies"](https://publicseminar.org/2017/10/why-do-you-call-us-ladies/) just upper-class, wealthy, white women or women from all races, associated with the Confederate flag?
Traditionally, ["ladies"](https://publicseminar.org/2017/10/why-do-you-call-us-ladies/) are just upper-class, rich, white women, but I see members of all races being ["ladies" and "gentlemen"](https://empoweringwomennow.com/23-characteristics-of-a-classy-lady/) in the true sense of being able to take care of a home and do fulfilling work in life.
I love that homes can include African American art and culture.

<br>

## The Country Music and the Healing ##
It healed my relationship to the Country.
I was already from the South, but negative memories of the South and race that infiltrated my thought were chased away.
I already loved the sound of the trains, but it brought me closer to the nation-wide railways.
I was already aware of the lumber industry and my great grandfather's work in it, but it brought me one step closer to it. I learned to love those presently working in the lumber industry.
I already knew Tennessee Blues and Virginia Bluegrass music, but it brought me one step closer to this light-hearted music as well as the Jazz music pictures in Norfolk.
I once took mandolin lessons and played piano, and it led me to dig deeper into myself to play more spontaneously.
I was already from Virginia, but it shed light on West Virginia, nearby, and brought me one step closer to Old Virginia.
I thought I was relating to the South, but it made me aware of the beauty of the West, and the freedom in the South.
I already had ancestors who rode astride, but I grew more aware of the global trend of riding astride.
I had already been to South America, but it brought me more love for the South Americans and Spanish Americans.
I had already been to Scotland and Ireland, but it woke up my memories of a love for Scottish and Irish music.
I had already traveled to the West to visit the natives, but it called my attention to the greater whole.
I had already felt denied by Southern culture, but it woke me up to my Southern mom.
I was already aware of the trucks at the Port and on the roads in Bristol, but it led me to love the truck drivers more everywhere.
I had thought Country music was just for White People, but I realized I already listened to and played country music produced by African Americans.

<br>

## From the South, Subjectivity ##
Other people are also from the South and have individual meanings, memories, and roots associated with the South. Not everything is centered around my ancestors and me. Other people are living and have meanings, memories, roots, and ancestors associated with music on the South.

<br>

## At the Root ##
At the root is the same heart responding and reacting to the same culture.  The same heart is at the root singing, appreciating, and interpreting.

<br>

## Cars on the Roads #
In the red, white, and blue, where there are all sorts of people.
Every one is individual.
All sorts of cars of many hues are driving on the same roads.
Weaving in and out through the cities and the land, we all live in one country under the God in which we trust.
## engineering, math, the distance between cars, everyone is individual, a sea of cars ##

<br>

## America ## 
Digging into the depth of the earth, wedded to the earth,
where the soil is thick
and knows her story
and leaves room for all to grow in their own way.

<br>

## Opening Up, Anger, Strife ##
Shoving the things down that I should not share.
Feeling uncomfortable, embarassed, and over-exposed.
It's ok... I can rise up another day.

<br>

## Letting It Go and Moving On ##
I let it all go, and I got in the car.
I drove through Bristol, Nashville, Memphis, and across the Arkansas Bridge to West Memphis.
Then I drove through Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and the Rust Belt, across another bridge over the Ohio River.
I met some new friends, stayed in some hotels, heard some new stories, read some new books, saw new artwork,
and traveled back down West Virginia Country Roads, where everything felt like home in a new way.
Driving by the train tracks, feeling the freshness of the Rivers, and seeing the Americans doing their work,
America felt new, yet the same.
I remembered my family, and the deep, deep roots that run through the ground.
I saw why people want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, but it has always been great and will always be great.

<br>


## Georgia ##
Traditionally, there's racism in Georgia.
As I look more deeply, I see how White Americans are innocent.
The land has been taken back, restored, and freed from slavery.
There are white-only plantations, and African Americans who have taken back the land.
There are White Americans and African Americans eating together at diners.
Thank you, God, for the good you do through your Christian brothers and sisters.
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s work was so powerful.
Your eyes were on the prize all along, leading your people along.

<br>

## Social Media Usage ##
Why look her, or him up one more time? 
Lurking on social media; why lurk behind the scenes again?
I put a stop to the lurking, and control my usage.
I even delete the application on my own, and seek new online applications.

The images are beautiful; I am receiving Christmas Cards all years.
It's a place to express love, and appreciation, and meet people from a distance.
It's a place to see the beauty, and childlike grace, and innocence expressed in everyone.
People express joy in amazing ways and share that with everyone online.

...but why open up so much to strangers from a distance?
Use wisdom, carefulness, and caution. Don't be someone from the outside looking in through the window you should not look through.

Be someone on the inside, being safe, being a friend to those you know.
Share photos like a Christmas Card, but limit the usage to those you know.

I am Margaret Furr.
I love to write.
I love Country music.
I understand people in the Rural South.
I love people who love Country music.
I understand and have expressed the underlying sentiment of the Outlaw Country.
I am from the Urban South.
I loved aspects of the Rural South.
African Americans and Black people belong to the Republican Party.
African Americans and Black people belong to the Country.
African Americans and Black people are free to express Country music differently.
People like Elvis lived with Black people and were inspired by and took music from Black people, which is why some people find White Culture as dangerous and people like Elvis as racist.
There is destructive behavior in both the African American community and the White Community. What drives this destructive behavior? 
Sin

In the past, I have felt less comfortable with my voice, my thoughts, and my sexuality than do other people.In the past, I have felt like I am working all the time.
In the past, I have felt like people make me feel very bad about myself for fundamental aspects of who I am and what I desire to do.
In the past and in the present, I have felt concerned about not being original fully.
In the present, I am growing more concerned about appreciating other people as fully human with interests, talents, and full expression, originality, and ideas.

Liberal Arts is about expressing freedom, being a free(er) thinker, using good judgment, discerning the false from the true.
Liberal Arts is supposed to be a broad education for a democracy.
Liberal Arts teaches people to read and write and also express through the Arts.
Norfolk Academy is a Liberal Arts school.
Liberal Arts is Cultural Analysis.
Christian Science is supposed to be a broad education.from Latin liberalis "free" and ars "art or principled practice"

In the past in the South not everyone has been fully free.
Being fully free means being not enslaved.
Healing prejudice.
Not all Black people have been enslaved.
Some Black people in other countries have never been enslaved.
Some White people have been enslaved in other parts of the world.
Everyone is individual.

I remember in Church appreciating the expression of Soul in the woman in the "Healing Racism" workshop.
My family in the past was driven by social status and money.
I heard strong opinions and judgments.
I have learned to judge less based on hair color and house style and money.
I have felt inferior to family members who make more money and seem more free and more talented.
I have felt superior to family members who make less money and also seem more free and less stressed out.
I have appreciated people on the Street who I can talk to openly about thoughts, feelings, and philosophy, and music, and Soul
As a conscientious thinker, I feel like everything I do needs to flow into a Church, where people make me feel like I am jealous or inferior.

People have refused to speak to me and have exerted a sense of control over me because I seem not to match up to the full functioning capacity or intelligence level of other humans.

Black / White Thinking
Traditionally, there is racism in the South.

Soul belongs to everyone.
Talent stems from Soul.
From sense to Soul.
Talent stems from one's heart.
I work to see everyone as expression of Soul

Some of my family members have enjoyed Southern Culture and Debuts.
For me, because Discrimination was such a big part of everything, I have done work to be more inclusive of Black people and African American people.
The Confederate Flag is a political thing.Southern Patriarchy is a political thing.

I felt like I saw the Soul expressed through people at work very clearly.
I am concerned about criminality
I am concerned about me not being able to play music
I am concerned about people making fun of me
I am concerned about me nervous laughing
I am concerned about people condemning me
I am concerned about people technology usage

In situations where there have been conflict, it is challenging because I feel like I am trying to do the work with my best effort and a good attitude but I can't fully read the mind of the supervisor and they have another vision for the work. 

If they feel like they have another vision for the work than how I am approaching something with my best effort, then it's frustrating for me because it's not being communicated, and it's frustrating for them because it's not being executed. 

If the approach I take does not match up with the vision they have then I need to feel punished for that, but there's no direct flow of communication clarifying the goals, approach, and output for the project. 

People do not like hiring younger people because they are not comfortable with ambiguity, lack of structure, or lack of clarity. 

People sometimes push the blame on younger people for not doing work clearly or making it difficult. 

Leaders and younger people must respect each other's places, lead downwardly and upwardly to clarify and communicate the goal for a project, assumptions, and what is being done. 

It's good management practice to be open to communicating openly as a manager and an employee about work and workflow so that people meet eye-to-eye and clearly understand what is going on. It is good for people from both sides to ask good and thoughtful questions so that people can understand.

If a younger individual is not a good communicator, they won't know how to ask the right questions, examine assumptions, or correct people. 

Younger interns or employees need mentors or support figures like practitioners outside of an employment role who can help them understand how to speak up effectively if something seems wrong or questionable. If someone really needs healing also, summer interns need to know what resources are accessible to them for support and how to feel ok with opening up about sensitive issues.

If someone advises someone to get a graduate degree, why should they get that degree? Who is paying for it? Where does it lead? Better advice for someone might be," think about what projects and tasks you enjoyed and what you would like to continue to expand or learn in the future". Some interns after this program have moved on to the following activities: graduate programs, mission trips, further employment. These options can be considered and evaluated based on what is discovered through life.

From a metaphysical standpoint, when working with colleagues, there is only the Source, one Mind directing the work, leading, governing, and following. From a metaphysical standpoint, God is always governing the way.

We are in a new age.

What is healing racism?
Perceiving the full picture, seeing the whole person, seeing the whole-Souled individual, seeing the full culture, seeing new possibilities, seeing the full history, appreciating the full heritage, perceiving someone in the true light, perceiving the beauty of Black skin, seeing the animus and individuality of an individual, seeing the interests, passions, and full freedom, latent abilities, talents, and possibilities of an individual, seeing the full ethnicity

Healing is about Freedom and Wholeness
Intuition is about Freedom and Wholeness

The Confederate Flag seems to communicate something symbolizing enslavement, derogatory things, discrimination, and fracture, as well as social status and Southern culture
The American Flag and the expression "America" can mean different things to people and symbolize different things

# Precis #
In her internet journal entitled 'Teaching Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn published in July of 1995, Shelley Fisher Fishkin argues that students should study the novel because it can make a difference in addressing the issues of racism. By making opinions and providing examples for them, she develops her argument. Fishkin describes the difference the novel can make when taught correctly in order to make the novel have a bigger impact. She encourages educators to teach the irony and satire Tain uses through a serious and urging tone.

Gregory Roberts, the writer of the internet journal, "'Huck Finn' a masterpiece - or an insult', published on November 26, 3003, suggests the importance of teaching *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* in high schools. He makes this suggestion clear by providing research and quotes from other sources. He presents research from both sides of the argument in order to give the correct view of the issue. Roberts uses a formal tone as he presents information to the general public.

Eugenia Harris asserts that *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* teaches us about American culture and we should thus continue to teach it in internet article "'Huck Finn' still pushes buttons, professor says', pbulished on September 26, 2000. Harris develops her assertion trhough using research and arguing against the opinions of others. She explains that books that have challenging content cause discussion and allow people to grow up in order to persuade readers of the importance of reading *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. Using a critical and assertive tone, Harris intends to convince the general public the importance of teaching the novel.

## Analysis of Frederick Douglass ##
If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to **deepen** my **conviction** of the **infernal** character of slavery, and to fill me with **unutterable loathing** of slaveholders, it was their **base ingratitude** to my poor old grandmother. She had served my old master **faithfully** from youth to old age. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his service. She had **rocked** him in **infancy**, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brown the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was neverhtless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided like so many **sheep**, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single wood, as to their or her own destiny. And, to the cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendship barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having **outlived** my old master and all his children, having seen the **beginning** and **end** of **all** of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already **racked** with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in eprfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die!

The hearth is **desolate**. The children, the **unconscious children**, who **once sang** and **danced** in her presence, are gone. She **gropes** her way, in the **darkness** of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the **voices of her children**, she hears by day **the moans of the dove**, and by night **the screams of the hideous owl**. All is **gloom**. The grave is at the door. And now, when **weighed down** by the pains and ahces of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the **beginning and ending of human existence most needful time**, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can existence meet**, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at the time, this **most needful time**, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent--my poor old grandmother, the **devoted mother** of twelve children, is left all **alone**, in younder little hut, before a few **dim** embers. She stands-- she sits--she **staggers**--she **falls**-she **groans**-she dies--and there are **none** of her children or grandchildren **present**, to **wipe** from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteous God visit for these things?

## The New President of the United States of America ##
Three months ago, fellow Americans elected a new President of the United States. Three weeks ago, hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans gathered to support the inaugration of a new President of the United States. Millions of Americans show excitement for their new President of the United States. Millions of Americans show excitement for their new President of the United States because having had a Black father and a White mother, he truly represents the American people.

Now we have many great tasks at hand must have determination in order to create peace as a unified nation. THe importance of continuing the equality and liberty for all Americans still remains present. We are involved in a global struggle on terror and many wars. We also have both an energy crisis and an economic crisis rising. Obama, representing everyone, is in touch with all Americans; we can take advantage of this strength of his to improve our country. As a unified nation, regardless to our religion, ethnic background, or gender, we can invest in these responsibilities with a loving heart and empathy to mankind.

Now that President Barack Obama has stepped into the White House, we must continue to strive for a better America by showing determination in our lives and by supporting our new president. Because an African American has become President, it could cause Americans to forget our need for equality among all people. We cannot overlook the importance of this liberty that our fathers based the founding of the United States of America. We must strive for the change our president plans by working to our best potential on a daily basis. We cannot live with nice luxuries if our country as a whole is not committed to working hard. Finally, with the goal of creating peace, we must express helpfulness, empathy, and compassion to all. America can change for the better with President Barack Obama's help.

## Whitman and Dickinson ##
Both Whitman and Dickinson use their poetry as a device to explore themselves as an individual through a personal tone. They guide the reader into their personal piece of work by beginning in the 1st person. To open his poem, Whitman writes 'I celebrate myself', a phrase that contains two words that signify the self. Dickinson continues to write about himself as he uses the word 'I' seven times throughout his poem. Similarly, Dickinson writes 'I'm Nobody!' and uses the contraction of 'I am' to inform the reader that hse is going to explore herself. Whitman and Dickinson both compare themselves to others explaining either the difference or similarity of how other people in society view their selves. Whitman uses the line 'what I shall assume you shall assume' which emphasizes 'I' and 'you' to represent equlaity amongst humanity. He then continues 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you' which not only again emphasizes 'me' and 'you', but also emphasizes the word 'good'; Whitman portrays his realization that he is a unique and 'good' individual, and he reassures others that they are unique and good individuals as well. Dickinson relates herself to others as well by devoting her first paragraph to how she feels as a 'nobody' and her second paragraph to explain how others are 'somebodys'. Whitman and Dickinson both describe how they feel about themselves through literary devices; both poets use the device, connotation. Whitman portrays himself as calm and free when he writes that he is at ease watching 'summer grass'; the imagery of 'summer grass' suggests grass moving with the wind on a relaxing summer day. Dickinson also uses connotation when she explains herself as a 'nobody' and others as 'somebodys'. In the way she utilizes 'somebody', she gives the connotation of an important and popular person, and in the way she utilizes 'nobody', she gives the connotation of unimportant and unrecognized person.

While both poets explorer themsleves in their poems, Whitman's view on himself differs from Dickinson's view of herself. This is not only shown through their word choice, but also through their syntax, meter, and tone. By giving a celebratory tone in his opening, 'I celebrate myself, and sing myself', he shows that reader his content with himself. He continues to give a sense of pride and freedom when he writes, 'I loafe and invite my soul'; he feels confident with letting his soul free. Dickinson, on the other hand, represents a negative tone when she exclaims that she is a 'Nobody!'; she does not yet feel content with herself as a unique individual. Unlike Whitman's expressing a friendly tone when he reassures the reader that 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to [him]', Dickinson gives a critical tone exclaiming 'how dreary - to be Somebody!' Dickinson also expresses jealousy when she uses this critical tone; often one is jealous of the quality he is critical of. Through their differing styles, they also show their view of their self. Whitman's poetry has no meter but forms rhythm through his lists and wording; by doing this, he uses a free and extensive style, representing his confident self. Dickinson on the other hand, protrays dissatisfaction with the self by using a restrictive style with iambic meter and a more restrained pattern in the number of syllables. The syntax of each poet shows how he veiws the self as well. Whitman utilizes an idiom and a longer, more detailed phrase, 'Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same'. By writing long, detailed phrases like this one, he portraying an extensive and free self. Unlike Whitman, Dickinson writes simpler sentence and shorter lines. In one of ehr longest lines of eight syllables, she writes a two word sentence and a four word sentence, 'Don't tell! they'd advertise-you know!' Dickinson shows a restrictive self."

## Whitman and Dickinson ##
Walt Whitman, a poet who wrote in a unique style without boundaries, first published *Leaves of Grass* in 1855. It did not become 'Song of Myself' until 1881, and an 1892 edition was later published. Between the publications of *Leaves of Grass* in 1855. It did not become 'Song of Myself' until 1881, and an 1892 edition was later published. Between the publications of *Leaves of Grass* and 'Song of Myself', Whitman made many revisions to his poetry. Emily Dickinson, another poet from the nineteenth century, wrote works that served as a change in the literature in her time period. She first began writing poetry seriously in 1858, and seh continued her writing until death. She did not title her poetry, but her poem beginning, 'I'm Nobody!' dates to the approximate year, 1861. Like Whitman's 'Canto 1' which explores 'the self', Dickinson's 'I'm Nobody!' also explores 'the self'. Whitman and Dickinson are similar in that they use the first person to present a personal tone, but these poets differ in their styles of syntax, meter, and tone in order to force us to contemplate their views on the self.

Both Whitman and Dicksinon use their poetry as a device to explore themselves as individuals through a personal tone. They guide the reader into their personal piece of work by beginning in the 1st person. To open his poem, Whitman writes 'I celebrate myself', a phrase that contains two words that signify the self (line 1, WHitman). Dickinson continues to write about himself as he uses the word 'I' seven times throughout his poem. Similarly, Dickinson writes 'I'm Nobody!' and uses the contraction of 'I am' to inform the reader that she writes an exploratory poem (line 1, Dickinson). Whitman and Dickinson both compare themselves to others by explaining either the difference or similarity of how other people in society view their selves. Whitman uses the line 'what I shall assume you shall assume' which emphasizes 'I' and 'you' to represent equlaity amongst humanity (line 2, Whitman). He then continues 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you' which again emphasizes the self and the reader but it Whitman portrays his realization that he is a unique and 'good' individual, and he reassures others that they are unique and good individuals as well when he emphasizes the word 'good' (line 3, Whitman). Like Whitman, Dickinson relates herself to others by devoting her first stanza to how she feels as a 'nobody' and her second stanza to explain how others are 'somebodys'.

While both poets explore themselves in their poems, Whitman's view on himself differs from Dickinson's view of herself; they reveal their view of themselves not only through their word choice, but also through their syntax, meter, and tone. By giving a celebratory tone in his opening. 'I celebrate myself, and sing myself', Whitman describes his satisfaction as an individual to the reader (line 1, Whitman). He continues to give a sense of pride and freedom when he writes, 'I loafe and invite my soul'; he feels confident in letting his soul free (line 4, Whitman). Dickinson, on the other hand, represents a negative tone when she exclaims taht she '[is] a Nobody!'; she does not yet feel content with herself as a unique indidvidual (line 1, Dickinson). Unlike Whitman's expressing a friendly tone when he reassures the reader that 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to [him]', Dickinson exclaims, 'how dreary - to be - Somebody!', giving a critical tone (line 5, Dickinson). By using dashes to split up her sentence, Dickinson also expresses jealousy when she uses this critical tone. Through their differing styles, they also show their view of their self. Whitman's poetry has no meter but forms rhythm through his lists and wording. Using the seventeen-syllable phrase that contains rhythm, 'I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard', Whitman uses a free and extensive style, representing his confident self (line 11, Whitman). Whitman also utilizes an idiom and a longer, more detailed phrase, 'Born here of parents born here from parents the same' (line 7, Whitman). By writing long, detailed phrases liek this one, he portrays an extensive and free self. Dickinson, however, portrays dissatisfaction with the self by using a restrictive style with iambic meter and a more restrained pattern in the number of syllables. Dickinson writes simpler sentences and shorter lines with six-eight syllables. In one of her longest lines of eight syllables, she writes two sentences - a two-word sentence and a four-word sentence, 'Don't tell! they'd adertise-you know!', DIckinson reveals a dissatisifed and restrained self (line 6, Dickinson).

As the two poets, Whitman and Dickinson went through life writing poetry and exploring themselves, it led to the publications of poetry about the self. Although they both search and discover about the self in their poems, their different mehtods including Whitman's extensive style and Dickinson's restrictive style reflect the overall philosophy and personality of the poets. Extending recognition to all individuals, Whitman grew up interested in the 'One existing throughout the Many' and promoted both himself and all unique persons in society. Dickinson's growing up as a reclusive and skeptical woman can explain her style and tone in 'I'm Nobody!'. Because Whitman and Dickinson ahve different personal beliefs, they utilize different methods, and styles which reflect their selves.

## "The New Colossus" ##
"It is not like the impudent and bold giant of Greek fame
Who conquers many lands with strength;
On our newly found and open gates shall stand 
A mighty and brave woman holding a torch
With confined flames, and her name is
The Mother of Exiles. From her guiding and fixed hand
She gives a world-wide welcome; her gentle eyes direct
That this harbor frames.
'Continue to display the important stories of your old lands!'
She cries with a shut mouth. 'I welcome your country's 
Poor and hardworking, your people that desire freedom,
And the unaccepted of yoru land.
These homeless people shall be sent to me,
For I use my lamp to guide them through!'"

## Chaucer, History of the English Language ##
"Experience, though noon auctoritee
Were int his world, is right ynogh for me
To speke of wo that is in mariage;
For, lordynges, sith I twelve yeer was of age,
Thonked be God that is eterne on lyve,
Housbondes at chirche dore I have had fyve,--
If I so ofte myghte have ywedded bee,--
And alle were worthy men in hir degree.
But me was toold, certeyn, nat longe agoon is,
That sith that Crist ne wente nevere but onis
To weddyng, in the Cane of Galilee,
That by the same ensample taughte he me
That I ne sholde wedded be but ones."

## Georg Puttenham, The Arte of English Poetie ##
"But after a speach is fully fashioned to the common understanding, & accepted by consent of a whole countrey & natio, it is called a language, & receaueth none allowed alteration, but by extraordinary occasions by little & little, as it were insensibly bringing in of many corruptios that creepe along with the time: of all which matters, we haue more largely spoken in our bookes of the originals and pedigree of the English tong. Then when I lay language, I meane the speach wherein the Poet or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine or as our case is the vulgar English, & when it is peculiar unto a countrey it is called the moter speach of that people: the Greekes terme it Idioma; for is ours at this day the Norman English. Before the Conquest of the Normans it was the Anglesaxon and before that the British, which as some will, is at this day, the Walsh, or as others affirme the Cornish: I for my part thinke neither of both, as they be now spoken and pronounced. This part in our maker or Poet must be heedyly looked unto that it be naturall, pure, and the most usuall of all his countrey: and for the same purpose rather that which is spoken in the kings Court, or in the good townes and Cities within the land, then in the marches and frontiers, or in port townes, where straungers haunt for traffike fake, or yet in Universities where Schollers use much peeuish affectation of words out of the primatiue languages, or finally, in any uplandish village or corner of a Realme, where is no resort but of poore rusticall or unciuill people: neither shall he follow the speach of a craftes man or carter, or other of the inferiour ofrt, though he be inhabitant or bred in the best towne and Citie in this Realme, for such persons doe abuse good speaches by strange accents or ill shapen foundes, and false ortographie. But he shall follow generally the better brough up fort, such as the Greeks call [charientes] men ciuill and graciously behauored and bred. Our maker therefore at these days shalll not follow..."

## 2020 -  Pivotal Year - A Draft ##
It's intuitively known to man that man is coexistent with God in one grand brotherhood that has the freedom to sing and soar far above the clouds.
Do I choose to live together with others in human strife, or do I harmonize with people?
This determines whether I, we truly can sing and soar, and this depends on my tone of heart, mind, conversation, song, and ears.

The first grand spiritual lessons I learned were to feel the love from my mom while doing homework, understand the lives of African Americans while watching 'Eyes on the Prize' with my dad, appreciate diversity in the human race, treat an enemy like a cousin or a brother, 'speaking gently to the harsh words', truly love the ex-girlfriend of an enemy rather than feel intimitaed by or compared to with her, love the kindred spirit of a guy I felt I liked on social media, and rally hear what the Holy Spirit, not human opinion, communicates about man.

There have been times when I've expressed humility when meeting President Obama and visited the White House to 'hack the gender pay gap'. And unfortunately there have been times when I have melted down, attacked people through horrible communication and threatened to kill people in ways that sound like President Donald Trump has sometimes sounded out of fear, envy, or pride.

Song on Pangea, President Obama Election, I Believe

The time finally came for me to choose, like a nation does, whether I turn to the light or to the shadow. Can I put downt he civil war sword of my grandfather's monstrous rage And the gun images I had sent?

We all dwell in the Shadow of the Almighty at all times whether we know it or not. But do I choose to make my bed in fear, envy, a sense of inferiority, physical pain, discouragement, anger, rage, self-justification, gun violence, self-mutilation, and hell? Or do I choose to make my bed in heaven? God will always be there behind the clouds of mortal sense like the Sun does, moving our receptive hearts and minsd always in the right direction, but moment by moment, I have the ability to choose where I make my bed. Psalm 23:4 'Yea, though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me' represents this spiritual concept.

My mom worked as a teacher like my grandmother did. As a mom, she exuded so much motherly love when she helped us with our homework. I used to feel like I wanted to teach and educate with that much love and joy of learning that she and my grandmother expressed. I remember my mom discouraging me from teaching because in their experience there weren't enough men working in the profession, and I remember feeling a constant mortal sense that I was dependent on men or desperate to be in a relationship with someone who would provide something.

## Destination, Journey ##
The journey is great, it leads to better, and higher views.
The journey is great, it shows us more of who we are, and how I can change.
The journey is great, it leads to the destination.
Life is a series of destinations.
Life is a series of stepping stones.
Running across stones.
Learning a lesson at each one.
Meeting someone at each one.
Reaching the destination or the series of stones and destinations.
Destination by destination, life expands.
There's no final destination, there's a series of destinations.

## Positive Memories ##
All the memories from the past still exist in thought
They can be made new
They can be brought to life again
I put them in a bottle
I send them out to see
Someone can discover all the memories from the past
"Good times and bad", "happy and sad"

## What do you think is the most important question in life? ##
'How do I love someone?' and 'What am I learning?' are the two most important questions in life. Answers to these questions provide the motives for staying active, moving, and being. With love for someone, if not all of humanity throughout the day, there is vibrancy in and a cause for the day. With the desire to understand a topic or a concept, there is reason and a cause for each day. A life well-lived includes loving the people around, learnnig more about love and the reason for living, and creating something to support people.

## What book do you wish you had written? What would you change in your version? ##
A book I wish to write is one on the cultural influences on 'Made in America'. Many ideas, and engineering and mathematical concepts come from other countries - Scotland, Egypt, India, China, and Italy and Greece. It would be fun to write a book about the cultural influences and 'Made in America'.

## Write about a time you felt loved. ##
Today, I have felt loved and fully forgiven inside. I feel so loved that it feels as if all the things wrong in my consciousness have been detached, and removed.

## What do you have to do today that you really would rather not do? ##
Looking for my passport feels like something I dread doing. It does not feel fun to search around for a passport; it feels like such a drag. Many items live on the to-do list, including this one, and this is the last I want to do. I drag my feet in doing it. Many items I'd rather do before it.

## Who was your favorite band or singer when you were young? ##
My favorite bands were U2 and Coldplay. I love U2's song, "It's a Beautiful Day". There's light reflected in the music, and it speaks to people. I also love Coldplay's song, "Heaven has a Plan for You, God Put A Smile on Your Face". These two songs are popular songs, and uplift people in non-sexual ways.

## If you had a child who had done something very wrong, such as stealing, how would you punish them? ##
If a child of mine had done something wrong, I would correct them and help them understand why committing that wrong is wrong. I would not make them feel ashamed of themselves; but rather, I would guide them to better ways of being and show them alternatives. I would punish them by showing another way of being, and ask them to reflect on the wrong, how they can be better, and why. I would trust that God is supplying all the childs needs through a righteous approach.

## What is a priority for you right now? ##
Disciplining thought and speech on social media and in interaction with people seems to be a priority. Social media, a virtual place where temptations to compare, stalk, harass lurk. Social media, a virtual place with beautiful imagery and intellectual conversations. It's good to go outside, run, skip, and take a break from social media.

## If you had a 'do-over' button, what one event in your life would you like to have a second chance at? ##
If I had a 'do-over' button, over a year ago, I would never have sent the letter with the guns and the gun emojis. Instead I would have continued to appreciate the African Americans and people in my life expressing love. I am grateful for freedom and trust expressed with African Americans, and spiritual guidance to understand Malcolm X's vision for racial harmony. I would not have sent the awful letter and awful notes, and I am grateul for an interracial society and freedom to feel connected with all of humanity at once.

## Write a letter to someone you see every day. ##
I see myself every day, and I was severely bullied and excluded in school.

Dear Margaret,

It is not God's will for you to be in this much pain, and this isolated at school, on the bus, at lunch, and elsewhere. All of the people around you express the light, and God always leads to the right relationships.

Love,
Margaret

## Write a one-minute 'Thank You' note to someone. ##
"Thank you" Nate Jones for helping me grow spiritually and be free. Thank you for your spiritual maturity, awareness, ability to overcome challenges, and love of humanity. Thank you for the love of your daughers and the love of people. I am happy for your new opportunity in North Carolina. God is leading everyone at once.

## Have you ever been significantly more or less physically fit than you are today? What was different about that? What was easier? Harder? Did others treat you any differently? ##
In high school, I swam and rowed. As a member of the swimming and rowing teams, I became fit with six abs and a lean body. I felt significantly mroe fit then than I do now. It felt harder to maintain that fitness. I feel more confident about myself when rowing, and I was grateful for the experience. Now, I am not as fit, and it feels signfiicantly harder to return to the state I was in, but maybe I will someday return. I don't think others treated me differently, but I felt mroe confident with people.

## What takes too long? ##
Writing a paper takes too long. In college, it felt like what took some people to write a paper in 1 day took me 3-5 times as long. It was fun to write, but it felt like I never had time to enjoy socializing with people. Most work requires patience, time, and endurance, and persistence; however, it felt painful when what took peers 1 day took me 3-5 days.

## Do you prefer to read electronic books or paper books? Why? ##
Paper books I love to read. It feels like an amazing experience to go into a bookstore and look through all of the paper books. I love the physical experience of underlining key passages and taking notes.

## There is a strong current trend among kids to read comic books or graphic novels instead of regular books. What do you think about that? ##
Regular books promote children's intellect and emotional capacity better. I think it's fine not to be too careful with kids reading comic books or graphic novels instead of regular books, and reading these in an educated way can help them become culturally literate. However, I think that regular books teach substance.

## What do you look for when deciding whether or not to date someone? ##
Genuine compassion, intellect, joy, and understanding I look for in people I date. Sharing strong conversations with people seems valuable when forming relationships so that people can understand one naother. Conversations require active, reflective listening, and a willingness to open up, forgive, and express honesty. Sharing common interests and love for activities also helps people form bonds. When dating, it's good for people to keep everything quiet and not show relationships so publicly. People don't have to know everything. Being able to commit to people also helps sustain lifelong goals and desire.

## What makes you feel humble? ##
Feeling rejected makes me feel humble. At a low moment of feeling rejected and humliated, oen must turn deeply within towards God, and ask God how to learn the life lessons, love more of humanity as brethren in the light, and feel purified, and renewed. Feeling rejected makes me feel humble because I must dig deeper, see more deeply, and really seek to know God 100% of the time. Feeling rejected makes me humble and helps me to grow in other ways.

## As a kid, what job did you dream you would have as an adult? What job do you have now? ##
Right now, my job is to help, heal, and pray. As a kid, I dreamed of teaching. I love nurturing people and helping people. I love inspiring people and uplifting people. I still would love to teach, but I would also love to innovate, to sing, to act, to dance, to help out at the post office, and also the Salvation Army. I love to organize, and clean, and systematize.

## Write about the beach: your favorite memory of a trip, what you love, what you hate (e.g., sand gets everywhere). Would you live on the coast if you could, or is it better just for a visit? ##
My family ventured out to the beach for the 4th of July. Young girls played in the sand with castles, shells, and waters. They loved the holiday, and their moms were ok with me waving at them. I love the foaminess of the ocean. I love that 7.2 billion people on Earth look to the same seas from different places, thinking of one another.

## Where do you like to do your journaling? At a desk, in your bed, at the coffee shop? ##
In bed, I love to journal, and do my best thinking. In bed, I find the comfort of the squishy mattress, and the soft sheets. I love the feel of my head on the pillow in the dark, while writing in the journal. While writing, the sun shines through the window, and I can hear the geese calls.

## Write about someone, living or dead, who you would you like to have back in your life. ##
I think it would be great to have back in our lives the African American men that the police shoot. Through God, and the life in Christ, their lives have so much power, vibrancy, and graciousness. I am grateful for all of the ways African Americans lead, teach, sing, make decisions, and help people remove prejducies. I would love to have the African Americans, and Chinese Americans, and innocent children in our lives being shot back. Every life has so much potential, vitality, and vibrancy in the world. Every voice is vital in the light, and every life is vital in the light.

## If you had the opportunity to write as a career, what would you write? ##
In a career, I would love to write a book about unity and oneness, and the power of the people. I would also love to write music. In a writing career, I would love to take the emphasis off of self and put the emphasis on Soul. I love the work she is showing on social media.

## What traffic sign best refelcts your life right now? ##
The sign guiding people to 'slow down' with children playing and running best reflects my life. I love this sign because of the childlike innocence expressed in it. In life, I am slowing down, and seeking ways to paay attention to the light, the joy, and the love of children more.

## Describe your most recent dream you can remember. ##
I had a vision come to thought before going to sleep of an African American woman with beautiful eyes and a lovely smile. It was a wonderful dream, peaceful and inspirational. In life, every day, I wake up to the amazing beauty and life of African Americans.

## What do you want more out of life: happiness or success? ##
Out of life, I seek joy and freedom. Success flows from doing work joyfully. I don't always feel free, but I seek freedom. It would feel wonderful in life to express love, compassion, intellect, creativity, adaptability, originality, vibrancy, independence, and interdependence.

## What is the best piece of advice you have ever been given? ##
The best piece of advice people have given me is to forgive myself and others, and wipe the tears, the sin, and the anger away. God has always moved me with a strong conscience and a strong heart. People react, but it's ok to forgive. People bully people, but God wants people to belong.

## Why do you think some people are successful in life and others are not? ##
I think people succeed in life when they express patience in the process of doing the work and love for humanity in the day-to-day moments. Sometimes people do things and get lost in the wrong beliefs, chains, reactions, idols, and situations, but it's never too late to turn around a life and become better and succeed.

## What song is in your head right now, and why? ##
A song in my head right now is one that I am producing on a new day. Through the song, I convey the light and nature in the world to wake up to. It feels light amidst all of the emotionally heavy things going on in the world, but I have been in situations helping people through the darkness. I have met people struggling to know how to live another day, and through the song running in my head and resounding in my heart, I desire to convey a sense of love and hope for the simple beauty going on beneath the suffering, and loss.

## Journey Writing ##
## Do you have a tattoo? What is it and why did you get it? If not, would you ever get one? What would the tattoo be, and what would it symbolize to you? ##
No. I think that tattoos look good on people and that people with tattoos break cultural traditions. I do not want to get a tattoo just to buy into a trend that others are buying into. If I were to get a tattoo to break free from traditional value systems, I would not get a tattoo.

## Write about someone you aspire to be like. ##
President Barack Obama is a figure I look up to. When facing adversity, he exudes great qualities. He does not seek fame. He did not seek to live and work in the noble office. He does not bicker and complain when facing criticism, attacks, and name-calling. He does not seek to be a prima donna. I aspire to be like him. I seek to express humility, patience, confidence, love, meekness, and graciousness. I hope to treat everyone in the nation as he treats people, and appreciate the interdependencies in human relationships throughout the land. Everyone has a voice, a right to sing, a right to express, a right to love nature, and a right to truly live and learn and heal. I seemed abusive and monstrous when sending images of guns? Would someone in a celebrity photo with the President send guns? Would someone in a celebrity photo with the President gossip, attack, complain, and cry? No, and no.

## How do you soothe yourself when you are upset? ##
When upset, I soothe myself through telling myself that it's ok to cry. I feel pain when I make mistakes. People make mistakes. It is ok. I will see beauty another day. I will survive another day. It's ok to not want to live. I will progress and expand and live life more to the fullest, however. I love the joy that comes from looking someone in the eye, giving them full attention and appreciation, and listening to understand.

## Does writing change you? How does writing make you a better person? ##
Writing changes me. Writing, a tool for expressing thoughts, feelings, experiences in words, helps to articulate and process the inner and outer worlds. Using the right words, forming the right sentence structure exercises the process of sharing what goes on within and around through speech. Writing transforms my thinking and helps me better connect to people.

## What bad habit would you like to change? ##
I would love to *stop* looking people up on Instagram and Google. I would love to stop sending hostile emails. Through loving the glory of a new day, the beauty in a smile, and the lessons taught in computer class, I will break the habit. Through writing down thoughts on Github, and in journals, and working with my hands, I will break the pattern, and the habit.

## What keeps you from getting a good night's sleep? ##
Ruminating over the past, the things done wrong, and the missed connections keeps me from getting a good night's sleep. There have been many nights when mortal, scary dreams and anxiety about the future or the things done wrong have prevented me from sleeping. I turn my thought to setting the right desires, loving God, and resting in the consciousness of God's provisions.

## Write about a time you broke something. ##
Once, I was fighting within so much that I broke everything in my house. It was a continuation of what it was like as a child when kicking doors and windows. There's a loud fight within, and it leads me to break things. I am building back up now.

## What, in your opinion, is strength? ##
Strength is the courage within to do what's right. Strength is the peace within to forgive and not react. Strength is the ability to accomplish tasks. Strength is the expression of love.

## What has made you angry this week? ##
All of the emphasis on self, comparing, and competing made me feel angry. Feeling rejected, teased, and mocked made me feel inferior. It feels like none of my work never measures up. Other people look like opera divas while people tell me I have seemed high maintenance, like an opera diva when I can't fully express myself, and like I have a fragile ego underneath.

## Struggling vs. Suffering ##
Struggling - fighting the good fight, persisting in the face of adversity, committing to the team, listening to mentors, working through the suffering, overcoming evil suggestions and beliefs with good, gratitude, helpfulness, and saying no to the "tempter" when wanting to do what seems wrong but desiring to do what's right.

Suffering - pain in silence with no ability while feeling like one can't speak up, one can't be heard, one can't be understood, always on the outside looking in, and like someone is being a mouthpiece for one's thoughts, feeling guilt and shame and guilt and shame, and endless ties to people who do not care.

Pain - empathizing with the needs with someone else, feeling the inflicted harm of someone, feeling the negative energy from another's heart.

## When was the last time you pulled an all-nighter? Why did you do it? How did you feel afterwards? ##
The last time I remember pulling an all-nighter was seven years ago. I worked through the night in the bottom of the library. Other students I could see studying in there. Doing the work was the last thing I wanted to do, but I pushed myself with eyes feeling heavy, and me becoming a zombie. Then I remember walking back to the dorm really early in the morning with the dark sky.

## Write about a memory you associate with the color blue. ##
Associated with the color blue, I have memories of my cousin playing soccer at the ocean front, and being my friend at the beach cottage. I remember blue pipes on the ceiling at the beach cottage, and I remember hanging on them with my cousins Mary, and Kim, as well as Mary's friends.

## What, in your opinion, is strength? ##
Strength is the courage within to do what's right. Strength is the peace within to forgive and not react. Strength is the ability to accomplish tasks. Strength is the expression of love.

## Do you have any dreams that recur? Why do you think you continue to have that dream? ##
A recurring dream I have is the one of the imagery of The Mother Church coming to thought before Association. I am grateful for the purity of the Church Architecture, and the light shining through all the churches. I am grateful for healing across the land, and respect for all cultures besides my own.

## What crime or faux pas would you commit if you knew you would get away with it? ##
Don't worry. I have already committed a crime. I have committed a crime on social media that in the 21st century leads to divorce, cheating, and trouble. I have created fake, faux accounts, stalked people, and called people out. I have spread people's names, and hurt people with words. I must stop. The social media companies are doing with my account what they are doing with President Trump's. If I get away with it, great - it's mortal mind. I must stop the crime.

## You are on the cover of a magazine. What are you famous for? ##
I don't care to be on the cover of a magazine. I don't enjoy taking a lot of selfies. I have no desire to be on the cover or front-and-center. I love working with a team and collaborating on projects. If I were on the cover of a magazine, I'd love to be with a team addressing a challenge collectively.

## Complete this thought: 'Today I hope...' ##
Today I hope to clean my room, do business work, go to Nate's house.
Today I hope to live with love.
Today I hope not to use social media.
Today I hope to take a shower.
Today I hope to uplift my thought for humanity.
Today I hope to live in peace.
Today I hope to pray the prayers we prayed in school for all schools nationwide.
Today I hope someone feels free of a claim that holds them in hostage and in bondage.

## What is a memory you would like to erase? ##
As a free agent, I would like to erase the memory of being 'a heartbroken cowgirl', a criminal, and a damsel in distress within. I am a free agent, I am able, I am intelligent, I have a good sense of humor, and I am quick to forgive.

## In what way are you selfish? ##
I can be a selfish person. When I dwell in self-pity, and complain about rejection, the slights, the things done wrong, the ways others are perfect, and I am not. I am selfish when I use the word 'I' in every sentence and harass people. I am selfless when I do the right thing, see the needs of a neighbor, put in the extra work for no gain, and provide to people. 

## Write about a good discovery you have made (big or small). ##
The biggest discovery I have made over the past year and in this life is that African Americans are life-giving. They have deep faith, they live poetically, they are strong, and they are overcomers. They inspire me to let go of prejudices and live another day for the higher good set before mankind.

## What modern technological device takes up most of your time? ##
Instagram takes up most of my time. I see all the photos of someone grabbing my attention. She looks like the perfect, ideal Southern woman, and virgin. She looks like the able, cofident, free, and singing woman. This appears as everything I am not. I have actually let it eat up my time, and devour my heart with anger, and violence. I also use this device to share my photography and sketches. Why do I need to put everything online? It eats up everything.

## What would you like to apolgoize to you, and for what? ##
I would like to apologize to a musician for expressing all of my heartache and heartbreak and violence over womanhood and relationships. I guess I seem entitled. I could not, can not apologize. There was never a response. All I felt was pulled to face my loudest triggers and insecurities.

## Write about something nice a stranger did for you. ##
Once, I lost my temper at Starbucks. I threw the coffee cup on the ground. I looked pathetic. I was a horrible person. One stranger pardoned me and prayed for me from her car. Another straner prayed with me near a tree to help me stay grounded in reality.

## Have you ever lived in another country besides your country of birth? Would you want to? ##
I have lived in Scotland, Ireland, and Argentina. I am grateful I rowed with the Scottish. I remember being alone in the dark and feeling lost when miraculously my Scottish rowing coach found me walking before practice. I love that I went to music concerts in Ireland. I am grateful for the readings and church services in Spanish in Argentina.

## Which is stronger, love or hate? ##
Hate seems to be strong. It seems to tear one's heart up and throw one's life into shambles. Unconditional love is the most powerful force in the world, however. It overcomes the strongest, most monstrous waves of hate. Unconditional love overcomes all through to the ends of the world.

## What do you think is the most important thing for today's kids to learn in school? ##
I think that the most important thing for today's kids to identify emotions, and develop healthy relationships with people that are different from them. I also think it is improtant for kids to learn how to manage money but not worship money. I believe in the next generation! :) :)

**Name** became a **type of career/success** because he was **trait**, **trait**, and **trait**.
"Colin Powel became an **inspiring leader** because he is **brave**, **intelligent**, and **ambitious**."
"Sandy Koufax was a **remarkable sports hero** because of his **work ethic**, **amazing athletic ability**, and **teamwork**."
"Because of his **determination**, **Martin Luther King Jr.** was able to overcome **educational barriers**, **prejudice**, and **violence** to become a **political leader** who changed America.

## For people who have made awful, horrible mistakes -- what questions would you ask them? ##
(1) How have you changed over the past 1 year - 5 years - 10 years?
(2) What have you learned in relationships?
(3) What challenges have you overcome?
(4) How have you rediscovered aspects of your true self?

## Periodically we have tension build up in our lives that requires a release of some kind. Some people cry, others punch, and some find a creative outlet. What is your release? ##
I have experienced heartbreak, and I had been listening to popular music in the music industry targeting heartbreaking females. It felt comforting on the one hand to listen to the music, but on the other hand I didn't know how the music would fully heal heartbreak, or an emotional wound. As soon as the musician posted photos of his girlfriend, with a guitar, looking like a strong woman to make it worse, in NOLA, where my grandmother was from, so much tension came to the surface. I didn't want to cry. I kicked a door, and threw my cowboy boots in the trash can, and I became a criminal online. I yelled out, and ultimately I learned to give my tears to God.

## What very dangerous thing would you do in a heartbeat if given the opportunity? ##
It's not a dangerous thing to do, but with a passion for music, in a heartbeat, I would work towards becoming a professional musician. I love playing music improv and composing music. I feel like I am becoming better. Also, in a heartbeat, I would take more painting classes.

## What is a personality trait you admire in other people? ##
I admire the quality of integrity the most in people. I think this means that one has to be true to oneself at heart, let God work through them intuitively, and strive to work ethically, morally, and compassionately. I admire thoughtfulness, and the quality of diving deeper into ideas once visited.

## Is our world today a better or worse place than it was when you were a kid? ##
I think our world is in a better place today. I think a lot has shifted, many lessons have been learned, and people are more mature, active, and expressive than when I was a kid. I think family relationship ties have grown deeper, harmony has increased, but everyone, mostly myself, has to watch for regressions.

## Do you like your name? Do you feel like it suits you? If you could change your name, would you? What would you change it to? ##
I love my name. My name is Margaret for a reason. I love that I am my grandmother's namesake. I feel that it suits me because we express similar qualities. I am intellectual, compassionate, and natural, and musical like my grandmother, Margaret. I love words, puzzles, and math like my grandmother also. 

I share the same name as Margaret Thatcher as well, and people have reminded me that I express much strength despite my follies and vices. I love that I am unique, individual, Margaret.

'Margaret' means 'daisy' in French, and flowers turn to the sun. Margaret in Sanskrit means 'pearl'. Pearls grow in oysters. Sometimes irritants come up, but the irritants grind against the 'pearl of great price' within.

My name is a Western-European name, and I love that people from other cultures share similar experiences with names being tied to meanings and ancestry.

If I were to go by another name, I would go by "Meg", but "Margaret" is amazing as well :)

## What is the last thing (or one of the last things you searched for on the Internet? ##
One of the last things I searched for on the Internet is the medieval music. I drew the connection between the cowboy culture and the knight culture. Love songs come into being from both cultures. People used to use the medieval organ to play love songs, "country" music, as well as church music. During the late medieval period, and the Scientific Revolution, people understood music through science.

## Write about a real or imagined train ride you have taken. ##
I have taken real train rides to Pennsylvania and back, and to Boston and back. I love looking out the windows, and seeing the scenery. People from different walks of life come on and come off the platform. I appreciate the hustle and the bustle in the train station. It's beautiful to imagine the dance of life in the situation, and on the train. What a wonderful experience it is to share affection with family members on and off the train.

## Write about a time you felt alone. ##
Alone, alone, alone, alone all the time I seemed like the epitome of a "damsel in distress". I made it very obvious to people that I was crying inside. I annoyed people. I held prejudices, and biases, and grievances, but I uncovered them; and I realized that I am never alone. People live all around me. I can be and am being a neighbor everyday in the neighborhoods, even the unsafe ones.

## If you could do one thing every day for the rest of your life, what would it be, and why? ##
For the rest of my life, if I could do something, I would take up the life of a naturalist.
I would observe and truly listen to nature.
I would take field notes.
I would write down 5 images, and 5 sounds every day.
I would talk to someone in person every day.
I would love family members, including distant family members, every day.
I would appreciate the study of history, a natural science.
I would appreciate the stories told in families, and people's ancestors, lineage, and heritage.
I would play music, take photography, and love more every day.

## What makes you smile or laugh every time you think of it? ##
Today, I randomly smiled at a stranger at Starbucks. She was so beautiful. She smiled right back. We recriprocated our love for one another. Our eyes met. We connected truly. I helped her. She helped me even more. I love how God puts a smile right on our faces even when we feel the need to cry, and break down. It's wonderful that God is always at work.

## What historical figure would you like to interview? What would you ask? ##
W. E. B. Dubois and Harriet Tubman are two historical figures I'd love to interview. I would love to learn more about their experiences as African Americans in the old American country. 

* What were your greatest challenges?
* How did you overcome these challenges?
* What did you discover in relation to white people?
* What were your hopes for the next generations of African Americans?
* Did you believe in God? How did God communicate to you?
* What was some interesting are people in your generation of African Americans?
* What did you enjoy about writing?

## Have you done any research into your ancestors? What interesting surprises have you discovered? ##
Through my grandmother, and my intuition underly someone's country music on "Going South", I discovered surprises about my ancestor, Dr. Thomas Walker, who discovered the Cumberland Gap. He surveyed the land, led the country West, and explored Kentucky before Daniel Boone. With the Indians as guides, they passed through the native land and discovered the birth of America.

## What do you look forward to every week? ##
Every week, I look forward to Monday mornings. The time of the week to start all the work I have to do. It's a fresh time of the week, a time to restart, and a time to rejoice. On Monday mornings, I love going to school, hearing the laundry machine, and seeing people at Starbucks.

## Were you ever bullied as a child? Tell a story of a time you were bullied, or a time you observed someone being bullied. ##
Yes! People bullied me as a child. I work on letting go of the sense of being bullied, and love people and forgive people. I remember on the late bus I desired to communicate and connect with people, but they made me feel bad for listening in, and people did not let me sit with them at the lunch table. It was awful! But I open up to the Holy Spirit's new ways of blessing people.

## What is one of your greatest blessings? ##
My family has blessed me with love, music, laughs, cheerfulness, athletics, and commitment since I was young I am grateful for many memories of our family reunions where we met and participated in activities harmoniously. I love that this family continues to bless me with emotional support and gatherings on farms and old houses. I trust that there will be many, many, many more good years ahead as adults with the next generation to come.

## When was the last time you felt needed? ##
Every time Nate calls me and asks me to give him a ride, I feel needed. I love hearing his voice, his faith, and his love for his family and the community. I have felt loved when he shared that his mom wanted to meet me, and he made me feel better when he said 'I would be a good mom'. I love feeling the motherly love for his precious daughters. I am grateful to know the Salvation Army and the Up Center, and feel needed there when I compassionately share items with them.

## If you had to do it all over again, how would you reinvent your life? ##
I would not reinvent anything in life. Yes, I have made mistakes. Yes, I have made people afraid of me. Yes, I have felt like I have failed and become angry. I know that if I choose to keep seeing the good in situations, trusting my higher self, and expanding on what I love, that all will reinvent itself for my future in the best way possible.

## What musical instruments would you like to learn how to play, and why? ##
With music being the most romantic artistic expression, I would love to learn to play the mandolin. I come from Virginia, the birthplace of bluegrass-country music. The mandolin supports well playing this fine Virginian folk music that has ties to Scottish, Celtic music. My soul desires to play refined tunes that sound like the wind, the chimes, the birds, the grass, the rose, the flowers, and the river in harmony. The mandolin is a golden instrument, and I would love to play it along with the piano.

## What keeps you from getting a good night's sleep? ##
Ruminating over the past, the things done wrong, and the missed connections keeps me from getting a good night's sleep. There have been many nights when mortal, scary dreams and anxiety about the future or the things done wrong have prevented me from sleeping. I turn my thought to setting the right desires, loving God, and resting in the consciousness of Love, God's provision.

## Are there any lines that you simply will not cross? ##
Simply I will never cross the line of buying a gun and shooting it. I may have sent reactive, and hateful messages, but I am growing more in touch with the true self that lies beneath the mask. The evil threats masks a clouds of doubt, of insecurity, of disability. Though I have made these threats and sent these images, never will I ever purchase a gun and shoot someone.

## What would you like to be forgiven for? ##
When feeling provoked or made fun of, I have lashed out or lost control. The lash out became so loud that I threatened to kill people. I would like to be forgiven for these awful lashing out emails. It hurts so much to express compassion towards people and not have people reciprocate. I would like to be forgiven for lashing out towards people when no one has responded. I would also love to be forgiven in relationships so that if I find healthy relationships, and someone who feels like a 'soul mate' people will accept, and support me.

## Do you have anyone in your life that has acted as a mentor to you? Have you ever helped someone else out in this way? ##
Some individuals at EVERFI acted as signficant mentors to me. The lead systems and data architect at EVERFI mentored me, believed in me, and gave me opportunities to work with the Engineering team. A woman on the marketing team was also someone with a vibrant attitude who I looked up to a lot. I have helped people in this way when younger men have reacted out to ask about data science.

## Describe the most beautiful sound you have ever heard. ##
The church bells ringing through my ears make me feel so good. I think them chiming are a beautiful sound. I love the sound of the trees moving with the breeze, and I find peace in the sound of the harmonious silence. There exists a power in silence. Beautiful sounds fill the Earth each and every day. Another one I love is the sound of children laughing from an apartment window.

## You have a child and you have written one piece of advice that will be carried in his/her pocket for life. What is that advice? ##
There is a child within you first. She is innocent, free, light-hearted, and joyful. She has a good sense of humor, and she's quick to get back up and try new things. She loves to sing, and play music, and play with little ones. she also loves the sound of children playing.

For my child, I hope she sees how much love there is for everyone around her. I hope she keeps her childlike sense of wonder and motherly love, and freedom to do what God leads her to do. I hope that she carries in her pocket the advice to not let the weight of the world, and human opinions touch her. I hope she proceeds with love each, and every day.

## Write about the last time you felt guilty. ##
Yesterday, I felt guilty. I reacted on social media yet again. I looked up those people that look like celebrities yet again. I was mean because I felt inescure. I am guilty of feeling insecure, jealous, and like a wretch. I am guilty of carrying that attitude that Emily Dickinson carries - "I am no one!" I am guilty of the need to let go of an infatuation. It is awful. I move on to new, and healthier relationships.

## What is something you have dreamed about? ##
This morning, I dreamed of a roommate, a friend, who recently had a daughter. I dreamed of how much love I had for her, her daughter, and her husband, the father. I love the motherly love, and fatherly love, and restored fatherly love with no insecurity, attacking - just pure fatherly-motherly love supporting in harmony.

In the past, I have listened to music by Al Green and appreciated the African American music in Memphis. It turned from dream to reality, when I met the man whose father played music with Al Green in Memphis. I love the history of African Americans in the city.

## Do you prefer taking risks or having a safety net? ##
Having a net to fall back on supports taking risks. I love to express spontaneously, go on adventures, and test the boundaries to make new discoveries and build new creations. Taking risks supports me stretching myself. The last time I took a risk, I drove across the Arkansas Bridge and some other bridges. My family was there as a safety net, and so was my faith in a higher power.

## Diary Entry - 10 Years in the Future ##
Dear Margaret,
Remember how on this day, 10 years ago, how forgiven you felt for the first time for all the crimes done, and all the wrongs done. You had so much deep love and deep thought for humanity. You started growing in new ways, and waking up old passions for English writing and children's books. You started understanding cultural nuances more clearly, and finding full freedom from suicidal thinking. You had love for family so much on this day 10 years ago, as well as love for the little ones on the street. You let go of the things you needed to be letting go of, and you started learning some of the deeper things you needed to learn. Thank God for moving you forward for 10 years and bringing healing, color, good relationships, full freedom from suicide, and and fulfillment into your life. The sun continues to shine every day.

## Writing from Grade School ##
## Popularity ##
Popularity to me can be good or bad. It depends on who you are. If you were popular then I would say yes. If you weren't so popular I would say no because then those people sort of have to suffer. No matter whether you are popular or not you should always be nice to others. The dangers of popularity is that people get left out. Also, sometimes peopel who are very, very nice are unpopular when you think that they could be popular for how nice they are. I really, truly could go either way though.

## Competitiveness ##
I think competitiveness is away to see whether you have improved. You can compete with yourself or against others. I like to compete. I use both ways. I feel that competitivenes is important. An example of me competing is in swimming. During swim practice, I compete against myself in seeing if my strokes are less than before and if the way I swim looks better.

## Voiceless, A Stolen Voice ##
All I want to do is keep my mouth shut.
Songs sing through my heart.
Words play through my ears.
All I want to do is keep my mouth sealed.

Shared so much with you.
You could not respond.
You could not share a word.
And all I want to do is keep my mouth closed.

I have a voice.
I'm voiceless though.
I am speechless.
Voicing my heart is what I don't want to do.
All I want to do is yell out or be quiet.

They shut you down.
They keep you silented.
They ask you why you don't talk but they don't want you to talk.

## Children's Play and Hallucinations ##
Little children play with dinosaurs, dress-up clothes, Alphabet letters, and wish lists to Santa Clause.
Once in my twenties, people felt like I was tripping. Actually, I was tripping. I had been so depressed and stressed and felt so overweight that I starved myself for a whole semester. I was imagining things like a little kid does. None of it was real; it was twisted - the images and sounds were distorted, and they were not the full, big picture that God has.

I had so much work, and it all felt so overwhelming. I worked all night in the politics building with so many papers to write and exams to take. It was late at night and early in the morning in the political science building, and I was listening to English and Scottish Christmas music. It felt like a childhood game was going on around me while checking Facebook and other computer programs; my imagination went wild while writing poetry on envy, money, family, farms, and UVA, and I felt like I was entering a game on the computer. I wrote some weird lines of poetry; it's embarassing and awkward to look back on.

After having slept so little, done so much work, and eaten so little, everything felt so heavy while walking back to my dorm room. I even felt like I saw a high school teacher riding his bike outside. Everything felt "stranger than fiction", as they say, but I could still feel God. My roommate was there; she was beautiful, strong, smart, and interesting and she was from Hong Kong - but I was not fully sound mentally. It felt like the dinosaurs were roaring, and I had traveled back in time into the age of the dinosaurs. It felt like a terrorist attack. I could not move. I felt stuck, frozen, and after starving myself for so long, I rushed to go eat, where I felt the love of the people in the dining hall.

After leaving the dining hall to walk into the cold, brisk, winter air, it felt like I was in the age of the Vietnam War. Everything felt cold, gray-brown-dark-red-green in the depth of winter. I felt confused. Something felt off. I could not articulate what felt off. I knew God, and a sense of childlike joy and discovery in my heart; but I was fascinated by the distorted sense of reality.

I wrote emails madly to a professor, sounding like a lunatic or a mad woman. I met with him face-to-face, in person. I remember sharing how I felt like I could understand the primitive nature of the Alphabet purely through intuition.

Then I entered into the library and saw my friend. It felt almost like I was walking through a children's book or a video game. The light was shining through the darkness in the library, and the books of college guys sitting at desks reminded me of my dad there in the 1980s. I remember the angel voices, the angel monument, and the beauty of the Chinese students working at their desks.. and then I remember going to the church nearby to see people dancing like children.

I then heard voices - like middle school girls laughing, maybe gossiping but probably not, and high school guys bullying me and laughing at me. 
I had felt forgiveness for him, saw the light in him, but the voices became so loud. It was a distorted sense of reality. It was not really him. It was the ghost of him, and the ghost of me. It was the false him, and the false me. I rushed into his fraternity house, saw the light shining through window in the dark while the Christ light was speaking with the "still, small voice" in my heart, his heart, all of our hearts. I acted out some movie characters, like Mary Poppins, who taught children to "find the fun in every job that must be done", and Queen Elizabeth, who represents the ability for women too to govern and understand politics, and he called the police on me so I could be taken care of in the hospital.

It all felt like a computer game in some way inside the fraternity home and then in the hospital. Interacting with the cops, and handing over credit cards to people like women do when feeling financially dependent on men, can feel freaky especially after working to forgive someone and see the goodness and light in them. My romantic heart came up in self-defense, claiming the rose in my heart that needed to be nourished and watered. I loved all the nurses, and doctors, and people in the hospital, but I felt like I could hear the voices of my family - my cousins, my aunts. All the sounds felt like I was in the North Pole with kitchen sounds, and voice receivers; "what the hell is going on?" I remember questioning in the hospital, but I was tripping and imagining things in the way a little kid imagines Santa Clause and dinosaurs. The false senses were not real. They were distorted sounds and images because the human, mortal mind draws false associations between things.

My dad arrived, and so did my mom. They comforted me. They helped me feel the Christmas light that shines through the darkness and heals the "grinch that steals Christmas." The grinch was trying to steal Christmas. The grinch had been trying to steal Christmas all year, but when coming back down to Hooville, from the top of the majestic, blue Appalachian mountains, the grinch realized it had no power, and I could feel the light of the Christ speaking.

There was restoration between the bullying guy and me. There was some healing. There was some light shining through the darkness during the Christmas season. I had opened up to strangers, and felt exposed for thoughts that were not really mine. It was not really me.

At first I felt embarassed when looking back and remembering this all. Then I read some books for children, and realized that it's ok for children to imagine, so I could think of an adult tripping like a child imagining things, and it makes it more light.

I got into trouble, I violated the boundary of the fraternity house that my dad and peer were in, and my brother too; but translating the terroristic, violating images of thought into childlike images of thought sheds light on the situation.
