Currently, as we are living through a time of great change - not only technological but also social, I explore [social theories](https://www.thoughtco.com/sociology-research-and-statistics-s2-3026650)
in relation to daily observations.

### Understanding the Starbucks Event through [Social Phenomenology](https://www.thoughtco.com/phenomenology-sociology-3026630)

In the news, we read a lot about cases in which social biases lead to arresting people without reason. Recently, in Starbucks and other chains, people have arrested black men or Muslims for no reason as a result of their implicit or explicit social biases towards black people. 

"Two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks. 
A black woman was forced to the ground, exposing her breasts, at a Waffle House in Saraland, Alabama. 
A black man was choked by a police officer outside of another Waffle House in Warsaw, North Carolina. 
A white man at a California Coffee Bean location harassed a Muslim customer, asking her, 'Is this Halloween or something?'"

Here I interpret this type of event through [social phenomenology](https://www.thoughtco.com/phenomenology-sociology-3026630), which, in essence, "is the belief that society is a human construction."

Under social phenomenology, "people depend upon language and the 'stock of knowledge' they have accumulated to enable social interaction." For centuries, people have developed a language that denigrates black people, or more broadly, non-Caucasian people. The attack towards the diverse people represent one "stock of knowledge" that lead to certain types of human interactions and reality construction.

Starbucks has recently responded as a company by developing a more clear policy (information [here](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/you-can-now-officially-sit-in-any-starbucks-and-use-the-bathroom-without-buying-anything.html)). Anyone can use a bathroom or sit in a Starbucks no matter whether or not they have paid for an item as a customer or not. Additionally, the company is providing diversity and inclusion training (information [here](https://www.inc.com/sonia-thompson/recent-incidents-at-starbucks-yale-nordstrom-rack-prove-that-every-company-needs-to-talk-about-bias.html)). These actions help to reverse the language and "stock of knowledge" so that new types of human interactions can form and reality can be constructed differently.
