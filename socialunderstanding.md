Currently, as we are living through a time of great change - not only technological but also social, I explore [social theories](https://www.thoughtco.com/sociology-research-and-statistics-s2-3026650)

### Understanding the Starbucks Event through [Social Phenomenology](https://www.thoughtco.com/phenomenology-sociology-3026630)

In the news, we read a lot about cases in which social biases lead to arresting people without reason. Recently, in Starbucks people arressted two black men for no reason as a result of their implicit or explicit social biases towards black people. Here I interpret this type of event through [social phenomenology], which, in essence, "is the belief that society is a human construction."

Under social phenomenology, "people depend upon language and the 'stock of knowledge' they have accumulated to enable social interaction." For centuries, people have developed a language that denigrates black people, or more broadly, non-Caucasian people. The attack towards the two men represent one "stock of knowledge" that lead to certain types of human interactions and reality construction.

Starbucks has recently responded as a company by developing a more clear policy. Anyone can use a bathroom or sit in a Starbucks no matter whether or not they have paid for an item as a customer or not. Additionally, the company is providing diversity and inclusion training. These actions help to reverse the language and "stock of knowledge" so that new types of human interactions can form and reality can be constructed differently.
