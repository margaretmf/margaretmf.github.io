Currently, as we are living through a time of [accelerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up7K5sRqllw), I am observing trends, imagining a better world, and contemplating how the future may be shaped.

### The Future of Data Science as a Profession

According to Wikipedia, "Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and predictive analytics, similar to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)."

William S. Cleveland coined the term 'data science' at the beginning of the 21st Century. In 2001, he wrote, "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics."

Some people have compared the data scientist's profession to that of the doctor's profession. ["Tell Your Kids to be Data Scientists, Not Doctors"](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/06/tell-kids-data-scientists-doctors/), people argue. There are many types of doctors that specialize differently - psychiatrists, primary care physicians, neurologists, and more. Similarly, the legal profession has standards and exams admitting people to the field. The data science profession, still new, has not had these standards developed yet.

As the use of data proliferates through business, government and academia, and the new job title — the data scientist — emerges, ["an extensive committee of educators"](https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/10/12/national-academy-of-sciences-starts-framing-data-science-education.aspx) at the well-established National Academy of Sciences ["provides perspectives on the current state of data science education and poses questions that could help shape the way data science education evolves"](https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/10/12/national-academy-of-sciences-starts-framing-data-science-education.aspx). Questions include the following:

* Which components should be included in data science curriculum, now and in the future, and how should they be prioritized for distinct types of programs?
* How can partnerships between industry and educational programs be encouraged?
* Would a focus on real problems serve to attract more diverse students?
* How can students gain access to real-world data sets?
* How can ethical considerations be best incorporated in data science curriculum?
* What types of training would benefit faculty? And
* How can partnerships between two- and four-year institutions be facilitated?

While the National Academy of Sciences, established technology companies and consulting firms are working with General Assembly to develop data science professional standards. ["Everyone — from highly skilled data scientists to novices who have yet to write their first lines of code — must infuse data science principles into their work to capture the full opportunities offered by today's technology transformation. We're speeding this evolution within our firm by launching a multi-year journey to train thousands of Booz Allen employees as data scientists. And, we're excited to bring our expertise to help formalize the broader industry effort to codify a standard and certification through the Data Science Standards Board"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-employers-join-forces-general-140000723.html). As the data science practice expands, ["leaders across the industry need to work together on common standards that provide more transparent pathways to prepare individuals for success as data scientists"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-employers-join-forces-general-140000723.html).

In the future, I think the data science field can become more guarded with ways to specialize and ways to be admitted into the field based on the types of data a professional uses, the technologies they use and develop, how professionals receive education, the domain they work in, and how professionals move through different stages in their careers. General Assembly has started to support envisioning the profession's future by breaking down role levels in the [article](https://theindex.generalassemb.ly/why-we-need-to-redefine-data-science-7f05ab0286d4) as detailed below.

* Level 1: Foundation (Entry-Level): 
"To begin a career in data science, individuals need the bundle of skills in Level 1: wrangling, exploring, modeling, and communicating. With these abilities, professionals can execute on well-scoped tasks while relying on the guidance of experienced teammates. Level 1 skills serve as common building blocks and foundation for each of the specializations in Level 2, and they’re essential irrespective of company domain and size."
* Level 2: Application (Mid-Career): 
"Experienced data professionals typically specialize in one of the four Level 2 domains, each of which require a different focus, whether it be organizing complex data or predicting relationships among variables. Thus, instead of calling everyone within Level 2 data scientists, we instead call them data engineers, quantitative researchers, machine learning engineers, and advanced data analysts, to reflect the unique nuances of each concentration."
* Level 3: Leadership (Senior Role/Management): 
"For team members who seek leadership roles, Level 3 contains the bundle of additional skills — in business, governance, and people — needed to be a successful data team leader. Because these roles require generalization and problem-solving across the stack, successful Level 3s have often covered more than one Level 2 specialization during their careers."

### The Importance of Culture
What is culture? Culture is a set of social behavior and norms. And while culture is more "fuzzy" to define, nuanced, and something people understand through intuition, culture in this new age may serve as a differentiator for those developing modernized infrastructures.

As ["software eats the world"](https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), every organization has to think about how techology integrates into daily operations. And for those with the ambition to develop a differentiated set of integrated software components for a specific goal, the culture around that set of software components may further drive success and drive the shape of the technology.

How can culture drive the shape of the technology? In STS, there's a theory in which technology is arguably embedded in the social world. Technology is a set of tools constructed in a setting to support a set of social behaviors, so a knowledge and conceptualization of social behaviors can influence how people construct the set of tools.

In a world in which many companies may have the ambition to develop a differentiated set of integrated software components, it will be the organizations that combine software development with artistic endeavor, socially-oriented goals, intellectual rigor, and lively social norms that succeed. This is so because they will become multidimensional if done in a unidirectional way.

With these thoughts, I argue that as "software eats the world", culture is one of the last things to be "eaten". As software automates tasks, curates and recommends contents, and drives decisions, culture has to support the people creating the software or other products, services, and experiences, as well as making decisions with technological support; technology won't develop understanding of cultural nuances quickly easy - only humans can do that. Unlike artificial intelligence, cultural intelligence requires understanding the details in group dynamics, intepersonal communications, and unspoken policies; and culture develops through human authenticity, genuity, heart, and intellect. As society heads into a world where the market demands superieror experiences, culture will have to develop finely to differentiate one organization from another.

### Business and Social Impact
Leading thinkers have pointed out that people in the millennial generation and generation Z demand more socially conscious behavior than does anyone in other generations. Some people also argue that businesses more efficiently develop and use resources in comparison to organizations in the social or public sectors. If businesses generate the most value and run society through a free market, then how should business stakeholders hold businesses accountable? I think that for the world’s long-term growth, businesses must integrate strategic social impact goals with financial goals, and for people to compare businesses by how they contribute to social goals. 

I envision a world in which goals, like the social development goals, guide business institutions. I envision an ecosystem with intersecting organizations, institutions, and systems that contribute to the goals in diverse ways, while also monitoring metrics. I envision a world in which businesses listen to stakeholders. 

Work that supports this vision includes Paul Tudor Jones’s thoughts on [“Why We Need to Rethink Capitalism”](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=paul+tudor+jones+why+we+need+to+rethink+capitalism&docid=607992725060849506&mid=A1F558FAB9A6D4EB1CE7A1F558FAB9A6D4EB1CE7&view=detail&FORM=VIREHT), and it’s exciting to learn about alinear technological development that can further support reaching goals.

### Virtual Experiences Integrated into Business Processes
Data Science is a buzzword right now. Virtual reality will soon be also. The internet once was a buzzword. So was telegramming, I'm sure. 
But onto shaping the future with virtual relation...

* Imagine a virtual experience where a student, who is struggling to focus on afternoon homework needs some additional help, can see her teacher providing personalized AI-like support in the room as if she were there in real life.
* Imagine a virtual experience where people can learn history in a way so that places in the past appear present.
* Imagine a virtual experience where instead of getting on a phone call one can have what appears to be a coffee chat.
* Imagine a virtual experience where nurses and doctors train to take care of patients as if it were happening before a real job.
* Imagine a virtual experience where someone can try out different internal decorations in a home.

These are examples of ways this people may deploy this new technology. More exist, but the emerging ways businesses will have the opportunity to adopt it will open up new verticals and horizons.

Why will VR be helpful? Or will it just be a new gadget? I think that VR will become another way to minimize the distance between people through high touch experiences. I think that VR will become another way to help eliminate resources. There may be unintended consequences to prepare for, however; for example, with the rise of social media usage and the internet, people report that teenagers are becoming increasingly anxious and depressed, though technologies do not necessary cause this anxiety. Will VR have any secondary consequences on mental well-being, and how can technology deployers consider such consequences?

### Liberal Arts and Sciences Thinking
The classes in a liberal arts and sciences program cover broad topics; liberal arts and sciences programs develop fluid thinking. In a liberal arts and sciences program, one learns to understand and sense culture, read and think critically, dialogue and debate in writing and orally, as well as study phenomena objectively and scientifically. If one commits to a true liberal arts and sciences education, he or she will take courses across multiple disciplines from painting to classics to astronomy to computer science; and with a broad education, especially if he or she finds common themes that run across the disperse disciplines, he or she might learn to connect the dots across disciplinary boundaries; adapt himself or herself to different people, thinking styles, and situations; and develop a unique value proposition.

Often, politicians, businessmen, and technologists criticize the unrealistic, liberal arts and sciences education model. Critics argue that "a liberal arts degree does not prepare people for jobs." I argue that a liberal arts and sciences degree prepares people for future careers and supports their developing the abilities to think beyond a job or a title.

In the 21st century, with rapid technological and political change, uncertainties exist. [Leading management consultants talk about the various pressures on organizations due to change and the uncertainty about how the world will continue to change in the future](http://www.johnseelybrown.com/bigshiftwhyitmatters.pdf); the pressures on organizations then put pressure on people within organizations. Everything is in flux. The nature of work is changing. And people do not know what the jobs of the future will become. Thus people and organizations must work flexibily and fluidly.

To shape the world beyond what is in flux, one must be adaptable, have a strong educational foundation, and have an opinion. Committing to liberal arts and sciences education, where skills attained may be broader and cross-disciplinary, from writing to coding, liberates one to see beyond a highly specialized job and then work fluidly through the workplace. The education model liberates one to question what is most valuable and to influence what could be valued. The education frees one from the fear of what jobs will exist in ten years because students carry the ability to imagine what jobs can become.

The dean at UVA has introduced a [new curriculum](http://baconsrebellion.com/baucom-plan-change-world/) that facilitates more interdisciplinary studies. Critics might accuse that when I was at UVA, I was scattered while taking courses across the drama, history, english, computer science, media studies, and math departments; but by taking classes across the disciplines, I was able to see trends relating to global and technological change, revolutions, entrepreneurship, mental models, and paradigms, as well as develop skills ranging from writing to coding to speaking to modeling that can only enhance one another if well-used. While the liberal arts and sciences educational form does not lead to instant gratification in the professional world, I think that the ability to see phenomena from multiple perspectives and quickly shift perspectives will become helpful in the long term. People criticize the liberal arts and sciences form of education, but I think the education model will support freedom continuing to ring and America's values continuing to sing long into the 22nd century.

### In Honor of Marting Luther King, Jr. Day - On Strategic Thinking
Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered, among many, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC the following [words](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm):

"And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. 

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification' -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; 'and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.'"

The power of a vision, or a dream is strong.

People use the word "strategic thinker", claiming to be one. Through this blog, I want to argue that Martin Luther King demonstrated the art of strategic thinking through his sharing his dream to the nation. He did not speak as a president; he spoke as an African American in a country still segregated. He was putting himself at risk by speaking to the public. Not all in power shared his vision, but as a leader, he was convicted that the country was rooted in freedom and included all races, so strategically by sharing his dream, he had to support the systemic breakthrough for African Americans. Because of his strategic foresight into how the country needed to be shaped for the improvement of it, he let his voice echo through the valley, the hill, the mountain, the rough places, and the crooked places.

It's up to us to to live his dream, but I believe that we can continue to shape a world where equality is normal. We can lift each other up and embed values of freedom, equality, and inclusiveness into our systems - social, data, and technical. How can we do this? There may be ways to measure social freedom, equality, or inclusiveness in organizations. There may be ways to measure how algorithms affect social freeom or social inclusiveness. There may be ways to systemically break down mental, physical, or technical barriers by becoming more aware of what still blocks complete integration. These are just a few of many - but the dream, I believe, must continue to be dreamt, and lived strategically.
