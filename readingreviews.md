### [Beyond clichés: Teen anxiety prompts closer look at young lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives)**
On March 7, 2019, Chelsea Sheasley wrote an article, [Beyond clichés: Teen anxiety prompts closer look at young lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives), with the Christian Science Monitor. The importance and timeliness of a national health topic makes this article newsworthy.

With insights from interviews with middle schoolers, and results of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, the report explains why more teenagers experience anxiety. Sheasley summarizes, "There’s no consensus among researchers about what drives teen anxiety, although common theories include fear of failure, the rise of smartphones and social media, changing parenting styles, and a world that feels unusually chaotic." The report informs readers about trends in teen anxiety in concise way and synthesizes data from a variety of sources.

Moving the report on anxiety from what causes the illness to ways to help teenagers, the words, 'It's ok to be kind to yourself' highlight how education on self-compassion shifts how students can learn to respond to challenges and setbacks. Education as a solution presented in this article resonates with the products EVERFI delivers to schools so that students can learn about [Mental Health](https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/mental-wellness/), and [Compassion](https://thecompassionproject.com/about/), a way to help students calm down and better relate to one another. As Sheasley writes, anxiety does not have to be permanent, but building awareness of challenges facing teens, as well as how best to work with them inside and outside of the classroom, will help to address the public health issue.
