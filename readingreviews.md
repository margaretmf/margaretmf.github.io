### [How Hinduism Became a Political Weapon in India](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/hindu-nationalism-narendra-modi-india-election/590053/)
On May 24, 2019, Jonah Blank wrote an article on how religion drives politics in India. With eloquent language, the author, Blank, depicts the landscape in which Hindu priests read Sanksrit chants and engage in other religious activities. Then, he states "the creed of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)" - Hindutva, which differs from the Hinduism religion; and the relationship between faith and politics drives the politics of one of the largest nations on Earth. While the author uses great language and explains the difference between Hindutvi and Hinduism well, Blank fails to depict the conflict between Hindus and Muslims, which makes stronger the point of religion influencing politics.

Moving on to portray the holiest Hindu city, Blank shifts from the main point of the news article to a specific place within the story that provides supporting evidence of the relationship between faith and politics. Describing the politics, he shares how in the city "posters of Prime Minister Narenda Modi are slapped" everywhere with "orange-and-green flags bearing the lotus leaf", and citizens can see few election signs representing competing parties. Describing the relationship between Hinduism and politics, he explains how Modi, who has just won a second five-year term, seeks to reformulate the Hindu religion so that practitioners' grandparents no longer understand their faith; Modi is using religion as a "political weapon", and while Blank still does not mention Muslims, Modi is doing so amidst great warfar between Hindus and Muslims. 

What explains the radical change? Identity explains the change. People in the country, particularly those behind the Hindutva movement, need to reshape the caste system and "decolonize" ([India: how some Hindu nationalists are rewriting caste history in the name of decolonisation](http://theconversation.com/india-how-some-hindu-nationalists-are-rewriting-caste-history-in-the-name-of-decolonisation-114133)).

Blank writes about how across all major religions, "for many today, religion is less a matter of what you believe, or even what you do, than of who you are." Hindutva translates into "Hindu-ness", suggesting an element of identity, and people think of Hinduism as more of an identity than a theology. Until now, people in the Hindu religion would have never expected to agree in how they identify themselves; family, village, or caste have rather been at the root of their identities. The Hindutva movement, which began during the Colonial period, started as a result for a political desire for developing a shared identity to unite everyone in India, while not dictating what people should believe; and few leaders within the movement have been holy leaders. The Hindutva movement supported branding the country, not indoctriating the citizens. While Modi has not always worked on the Hindutva platform, the Prime Minister now uses it as a weapon and praises Gandhi, who reshaped Hinduism significantly more than the Hindutva movement founders did, to embrace nonviolence rather than to brand the country. Modi needs a tool to decolonise the country, and Hindutva serves as that tool.

As Modi amplifies the Hindutva pitch, Hindus war against Muslims and Muslims war against Hindus in the land. Campaigning on the Hindutva platform supports the country's national identity amidst this warfare. Summarizing the identity issue  behind Modi's work, Blank writes the following: "Instead, the issues are those of identity: We’re being outbred by minorities. We’re being laughed at by the world. We’re overrun with immigrants—and you know what kind. We’re second-class citizens in our own nation. Make India Great Again." As people in the US have expressed fear of minorities, and people who are different and not traditionally part of the dominant group, like Muslims, people in India have expressed similar fears. Campaigning on the Hindutva platform helps change India in the way people with concerns need it to change through the political exploitation of religion.

To further provide evidence in support of the article's main point, Blank moves the focus onto Delhi, another city. Hindutva determined the election results in this city; and Hindutva dominated the debates. Hindutva is helping through the heart to change the country and reshape it and the caste system ([India: how some Hindu nationalists are rewriting caste history in the name of decolonisation](http://theconversation.com/india-how-some-hindu-nationalists-are-rewriting-caste-history-in-the-name-of-decolonisation-114133)). The reshaping is not on the basis of religious ideology, however; the reshaping is on the basis of something deeper than the eyes - the heart of identity: "Hindutva is not about what your eyes tell you; it’s about what your heart tells you. It’s not about what you see; it’s about how you see yourself. How you see your identity, your brand, your place in the world. Understand this, and you can better understand the changes under way in India."


### [Opinion: The People Screaming for Blood Have No Idea How Tech Actually Works](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/opinion/facebook-google-regulation.html) 
On June 4, 2019, Kara Swisher wrote an opinion article on how regulators have grown more concerned with controlling technology but in haphazard ways. Swisher explains how over the past decade, technological risks have existed, but legislators have not cared what technology companies do with sloppy management of data and infrastructure a few years ago; warning signs of "rampant disinformation, egregious privacy breaches and in-plain-sight addictive elements built right into the medium" existed a decade ago, but regulators have never mitigated problems proactively or taken steps to understand the technology. Now, once problems grow more severe, legislators and policy makers enter the scene with legal pads to address privacy and security issues, but they do so in thoughtless ways that demonstrate poor understanding of the best solutions. Ultimately, Swisher argues that while she agrees that America must regulate technology, self-interest drives the current efforts, making them reactive; and America needs more proactive and collaborative work.

The author's negative sentiment on how the time has passed for regulators to step in and that they have not implemented a forward-thinking approach makes sense; but technology companies expect to build bigger, more expansive tools that may create even more risk  over the next ten years, so it is imperative that regulators do thoughtful work now. Swisher fails to mention the work that groups likes [Aspen Technology Policy Hub](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/#/) and [The Bridge](https://thebridgework.com/) have coordinated to connect policy makers, regulators, and technologists. As demonstrated by the thought from these groups, potential for creative collaboration and positive solutions lies ahead, and their work resonates with the author's concluding opinion:

"Instead of just reacting, we need our government to be creatively proactive. Regulators should be thinking about how to use federal incentives to spur small business creation to bring meaningful jobs and new innovations to this country; how to persuade investors to spread more venture capital beyond the three states (California, Massachusetts and New York) that get most of it; how to push for a more diverse work force and fund ambitious education programs, which other countries do without pause; how to anticipate the human impact of the next group of technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics; how to create the most forward-thinking infrastructure plan to modernize our cities; and how to encourage tech to focus on innovations to combat existential issues like climate change, and food and water shortages."


### [Opinion: Community ‘Weavers’ Create Stronger Social Fabric](https://www2.ljworld.com/opinion/2019/feb/23/opinion-community-weavers-create-stronger-social-fabric/) and [A Nation of Weavers: The Social Renaissance is Happening from the Ground Up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
On February 18, 2019 and February 23, 2019, David Brooks wrote opinion articles [A Nation of Weavers: The Social Renaissance is Happening from the Ground Up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) and [Opinion: Community ‘Weavers’ Create Stronger Social Fabric](https://www2.ljworld.com/opinion/2019/feb/23/opinion-community-weavers-create-stronger-social-fabric/). In the articles, he covered the work with the Aspen Institute to move beyond hyper-individualism and tribalism in order to repair social relationships through satisfying commitments and service to the common good. 

In a world where there's a rise in social isolation, a decline in commitment to religion, and an increase in partisan politics, people seek middle ground and alternative ways of being human. [Weaving people together](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/weave-the-social-fabric-initiative/), embracing people's deeper selves, and building bridges across divides through dialogue and creative expression helps to begin to meet the needs of those seeking substance and healing. Brooks's opinion resonates with work that people are doing elsewhere with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) to gather people together more creatively and artistically in both the secular and religious worlds; and research on [reimagining religion and creative communities](https://crcc.usc.edu/reimagining-religion-the-10-qualities-of-creative-communities/) also ties together with claims that lead to his opinion. To strengthen any news article on weavemaking, capturing the broader views on community development coming from leaders with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) would strengthen the story; and in stories covering community, there exists much to unpack given the realities facing politics, religion, the mental health system, and spiritual organizations. 

Brooks acknowledges well that highly political people likely will object to his critiques on the state of society, capitalism, and focus on spiritual well-being. Recognizing sources of pushback, and what the counter arguments are, conveys to the reader that he sees other perspectives. However, Brooks remains firm in his opinion that coming together to seek solutions in unity with one another can help individually and collectively to heal within during a time of political fragmentation. Community is not the only way to support people in a time of great change, mental sickness, and divisiveness, but it is a central part to health, and other solutions, products, or forms of human expression can flow out. Recognizing neighbors as whole and encouraging them to bring their full selves to their day to day work through "radical mutuality" underpins the opinion.

It's meaningful that Brooks refers to thoughts of deep thinkers when he writes, "Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to Martin Luther King Jr.’s conception of “the beloved community,” to Alexis de Tocqueville’s celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke’s preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological" to support his opinion. It will be exciting to learn of how people apply his opinion through action.


### [Beyond clichés: Teen Anxiety Prompts Closer Look at Young Lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives)
On March 7, 2019, Chelsea Sheasley wrote an article, [Beyond clichés: Teen Anxiety Prompts Closer Look at Young Lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives), with the Christian Science Monitor. The importance and timeliness of a national health topic makes this article newsworthy. This sits online as one of many reports analyzing the challenge facing teenagers.

Relying on insights from interviews with middle schoolers, and results of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, the report explains why more teenagers experience anxiety. Sheasley summarizes, "There’s no consensus among researchers about what drives teen anxiety, although common theories include fear of failure, the rise of smartphones and social media, changing parenting styles, and a world that feels unusually chaotic." The report informs readers about trends in teen anxiety in concise way and synthesizes data from a variety of sources; however, the report could improve with deeper statistcal analysis of data on anxiety as evidence.

Moving the report on anxiety from what causes the illness to ways to help teenagers, the words, 'It's ok to be kind to yourself' highlight how education on self-compassion shifts how students can learn to respond to challenges and setbacks. Education as a solution presented in this article resonates with the products EVERFI delivers to schools so that students can learn about [Mental Health](https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/mental-wellness/), and [Compassion](https://thecompassionproject.com/about/), a way to help students calm down and better relate to one another. As Sheasley writes, anxiety does not have to be permanent, but building awareness of challenges facing teens, as well as how best to work with them inside and outside of the classroom, helps people to address the public health issue.
