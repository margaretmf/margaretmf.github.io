### [Opinion: Community ‘weavers’ create stronger social fabric](https://www2.ljworld.com/opinion/2019/feb/23/opinion-community-weavers-create-stronger-social-fabric/) and [A Nation of Weavers: The social renaissance is happening from the ground up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
On February 18, 2019 February 23, 2019, David Brooks wrote opinion articles [A Nation of Weavers: The social renaissance is happening from the ground up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) and [Opinion: Community ‘weavers’ create stronger social fabric](https://www2.ljworld.com/opinion/2019/feb/23/opinion-community-weavers-create-stronger-social-fabric/). In the articles, he covered the work with the Aspen Institute to move beyond hyper-individualism and tribalism in order to repair social relationships through satisfying commitments and service to the common good. 

In a world where there's a rise in social isolation, a decline in commitment to religion, and an increase in partisan politics, people seek middle ground and alternative ways of being human. Weaving people together, embracing people's deeper selves, and building bridges across divides through dialogue and creative expression helps to begin to meet the needs of those seeking substance and healing. Brooks's opinion resonates with work being done elsewhere with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) to gather people together more creatively and artistically in both the secular and religious worlds. To strengthen any news article on weavemaking, capturing the broader views on community development coming from leaders with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) would strengthen the story; and in stories covering community, there exists much to unpack given the realities facing politics, religion, the mental health system, and spiritual organizations.

Brooks acknowledges well that highly political people likely will object to his critiques on the state of society, capitalism, and focus on spiritual well-being. Recognizing sources of pushback, and what the counter arguments are, conveys to the reader that he sees other perspectives. However, Brooks remains firm in his opinion that coming together to seek solutions in unity with one another can help individually and collectively to heal within during a time of political fragmentation. Community is not the only way to support people in a time of great change, mental sickness, and divisiveness, but it is a central part to health, and other solutions, products, or forms of human expression can flow out. Recognizing neighbors as whole and encouraging them to bring their full selves to their day to day work through "radical mutuality" underpins the opinion.

It's meaningful that Brooks refers to thoughts of deep thinkers when he writes, "Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to Martin Luther King Jr.’s conception of “the beloved community,” to Alexis de Tocqueville’s celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke’s preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological" to support his opinion. It will be exciting to learn of how people apply his opinion through action.


### [Beyond clichés: Teen anxiety prompts closer look at young lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives)
On March 7, 2019, Chelsea Sheasley wrote an article, [Beyond clichés: Teen anxiety prompts closer look at young lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives), with the Christian Science Monitor. The importance and timeliness of a national health topic makes this article newsworthy. This sits online as one of many reports analyzing the challenge facing teenagers.

Relying on insights from interviews with middle schoolers, and results of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, the report explains why more teenagers experience anxiety. Sheasley summarizes, "There’s no consensus among researchers about what drives teen anxiety, although common theories include fear of failure, the rise of smartphones and social media, changing parenting styles, and a world that feels unusually chaotic." The report informs readers about trends in teen anxiety in concise way and synthesizes data from a variety of sources; however, the report could improve with deeper statistcal analysis of data on anxiety as evidence.

Moving the report on anxiety from what causes the illness to ways to help teenagers, the words, 'It's ok to be kind to yourself' highlight how education on self-compassion shifts how students can learn to respond to challenges and setbacks. Education as a solution presented in this article resonates with the products EVERFI delivers to schools so that students can learn about [Mental Health](https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/mental-wellness/), and [Compassion](https://thecompassionproject.com/about/), a way to help students calm down and better relate to one another. As Sheasley writes, anxiety does not have to be permanent, but building awareness of challenges facing teens, as well as how best to work with them inside and outside of the classroom, helps people to address the public health issue.
