### [Beyond Birthday Cards and Hugs: The Rise of Intensive Grandparenting](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2019/0920/Beyond-birthday-cards-and-hugs-The-rise-of-intensive-grandparenting?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&cmpid=TW&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1569078043)
In September 2019, Chelsea Sheasley wrote with the Christian Science Monitor on how grandparents care for children in the 21st century. She begins the article highlighting grandmother Judy Dion's 78 mile drive to Cambridge, MA, where she watches her grandson for two days per week.

Chelsea reports that the boy's parents considered hiring nannies, but finding support from the grandmother proved to be more practical; and receiving help from the child's grandmother helped the family bond. Other grandparents like Ms. Dion have been providing this "intensive" care for their children's little ones as well; "grandparents raising grandchildren full time has grown to 7% of all grandparents in many cases due to parents harmed by the opioid and mental health crises in the U.S." Why do sociologists see an increase in "intensive grandparenting"? According to the article's author, "demographic and cultural changes play a role, as well as lack of structural support for working parents." Madonna Harrington Meyer, professor of sociology at Syracuse University, shares with the CSM reporter that "'what we're seeing now is grandparents providing care that looks more like parenting'" because parents have more tasks, stress, and personal problems and grandparents have the freedom to step in.  

Taking care of the children does not necessarily burden the grandparents; researchers find that "it is a nearly universal finding that grandparents do experience a lot of joy around their grandchildren." Katy Dermott, a grandparent in Washington, DC reports, "'I think it's better than I hoped, being able to be so closely involved...when you're a parent...you have lots of things going on in the back of your mind. It's such a delight to be able to bask in each moment.'"

The article's author reports that while grandparents enjoy taking care of children, they still have room to learn how to play this role. Sometimes grandparents juggle their own jobs or experience marital strife, so they have to figure out how to balance their time. Also, Chelsea reports that "communication with their own children can be challenging because grandparents navigate differing opinions about how young ones should be raised, yet they typically also want to respect their adult children in the parenting role." Grandparents learn that they must check in regularly with their children to smooth over the stresses for all three generations.

### [This Chilling Video from Sandy Hook Promise Shows How Gun Violence Is Destroying Childhood in America](https://qz.com/1710900/sandy-hook-promises-shocking-video-on-gun-violence-in-schools/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)
In September 2019, Annalisa Merelli wrote for Quartz on the school gun shootings, robbing America of its children's innocence.

With the start of a new school year, because of recent shootings, American children now receive training since the country's laws do not prevent gun violence effectively. The Sandy Hook Promise video shows the horror and fear that many American children have grown up living with as a result of the association between school and gun violence.

The reporter writes how many of the country's citizens believe tougher gun laws would benefit the public and reduce violence. The writer backs up this first sentence sharing, "for the first time in decades, more Americans dislike the National Rifle Assocation", and Trump has swung back and forth in deciding whether "to toughen background checks for gun purchases."

A video on the current issue supports this text, and the author does not write much more on the event.

### [More Public Schools are Embracing the Bible. Is it Literature, or Religion?](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2019/0918/More-public-schools-are-embracing-the-Bible.-Is-it-literature-or-religion?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&cmpid=TW&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1568851947)
In September 2019, Chelsea Sheasley and Patrik Jonsson wrote for the Christian Science Monitor on the debate brewing on "what role the world's bestselling book should play in education."

To invite readers into the debate, the writers quote the question that Jamie Davis, "a local youth pastor in Cochran, Georgia" asked seventh graders studying the Bible for academic credit, "'What does holy mean?'" The articles' writers report that the students do not know how to respond; "they [were] all stumped." The students' being stumped points to the controversy that exists over the Bible's role in public education. The reporters write, "that notion of holy as separate is at the crux of a growing controversy around Bible literacy classes that are springing up in public schools around the country – or offered in coordination with the school system, as here in Cochran."

The reporters back up the writing with facts: in 2019, 13 bills for Bible elective classes were proposed and signed into law. The new, optional classes are academic in nature, but people worry that conservatives use these classes to promote a Christian worldview in a country where people see Muslims as a risk.

The debate over the role the Bible should play in American public schools is not new; it is a decades-old one. The reporters write that the debate "centers around strongly held views of the importance of the Bible...that clash with opponents' desire to be inclusive of those of differing - or no - faith." The debate over the Bible brings attention to the fact that some community members feel in different ways that "their vision of what the United States represents is under threat and is being challenged."

People supporting the Bible elective bills point literary references and allusions to the Bible by Shakespeare, Toni Morrison, and others. Anti-supporters have concern for using the Bible to promote a one-dimensional way of living in the world. Supporters like Steven Fitschen, president of the National Legal Foundation believe that Bible literacy "is a really important part of cultural literacy" and in "understand[ing] art and music and history."

Sharing the history of court rulings against religion, the reporters write that "in the famous 1962 Engel v. Vitale case, the court ruled school-sponsored prayer", and "a year later, "in Abington School District v. Schempp, the court banned school-sponsored Bible readings, such as reading scriptural passages during daily announcements." Prayer differs from the academic study of the Holy Book, however, and the articles' authors note that "the majority opinion in the Abington decision also included a statement opening the door to a purely academic study of the Bible, as long as it's 'presented objectively as part of a secular program of education.'" Other court cases followed these two.

Recently, educator associations have conducted research on whether the public believes schools should include Bible studies; "58% of American adults surveyed said they should, 77% of adults supported offering comparative religion classes, and 4 in 10 Americans 'express concern that Bible studies may improperly promote Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.'" Regarding the law around the classes, a professor at SMU points out that "there is no need for new legislation for schools to teach the Bible in an academic manner - the Supreme Court has already given leeway for that." But legal research on the classes have revealed 'mixed quality', with some classes being "'blatantly and thoroughly sectarian, presenting religious views as fact and implicity or explicitly encourage[d] students to adopt these views.'" And "Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty (BJC), a faith-based group that advocates for religious freedom for all...raises concerns about states showing a religious preference and 'send[ing] a problematic message that to be a full or true American one must be Christian.'"

Covering the perspective of atheists, the reporters share how in one Bible class, the teacher, a Christian Pastor, who takes the First Amendment seriously, thought that the best student was a non-believer. Mr. Davis, the teacher shared with the articles' authors that this atheist "was super smart, asked the best questions, and was [there] to honestly try to understand, discuss, and learn", so attitude triumphed over religious beliefs. Christian students express how they enjoy the class also because "it is about stepping outside of church and looking at the Bible in a different way."

The authors report on an important topic regarding a debate over the state, a book related to church and culture, and education; and the responses to the debate may vary by local need.

### [Every Student Matters: Cultivating Belonging in the Classroom](https://www.edutopia.org/article/every-student-matters-cultivating-belonging-classroom)
In September 2019, Michael Dunlea wrote on classroom strategies that help students belong at school. Dunlea begins the story sharing how she received gratitude supporting a mom's son, "who had come out as gay" by affirming that "all people have equal value in the world."

When teaching young students in the first few years of K12 schooling, educators engage in "plant[ing]" the first few seeds in children's hearts and minds. And sewing the seeds of feeling like they belong in the place where they are secures them for life. The author of the article shares the fact that she has worked in an "inclusion classroom" where people have learning differences; including all students helps them feel more confident in moving beyond their comfort zones, and gives them a strong foundation.

Dunlea clarifies how she defines "belonging." In this article, she reports that "belonging in the classroom means ensuring that all students feel welcomed, comfortable, and part of the school family." How can teachers cultivate this? Dunlea reports five strategies:
(1) Shine a light on each student - this helps students recognize greatness within themselves and their peers
(2) Foster student identity building - this supports students in feeling empowered by their interests and passions
(3) Always leave one desk empty - this leaves room for people and signals that the classroom is waiting to welcome any extra individual
(4) Make sure that each child feels chosen - this helps create social equity and helps students form unlikely friendships
(5) Weave social and emotional practices throughout the day - this helps build a social and emotional foundation for everyone and creates integration

Dunlea closes the article, writing, "We can never take for granted the importance of our students feeling they belong. In a world that does not yet fully welcome everyone, schools can reinforce existing divisions or provide students a safe community that feels like a second home. That former second-grade student of mine went on to attend the prom with his boyfriend in our very conservative town and initiated a town-wide pride campaign. I have never felt more proud of my impact as a teacher. As educators, we really can help change the world, one child at a time."

### [Local News Takes a Stand](https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190930#1096435)
Doug Struck, a correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, wrote on 'news deserts' in September 2019. In areas with limited connection to substantial information and local reporting, news organizations explore creative ways to transform how they serve their communities with their staff. 

Struck opens the story with an account of a young reporter, from a local news startup in Ohio's Rust Belt, who welcomes a jazz quartet to the monthly news group's After Hours concert. Richland Source is the name of the local news startup. The after hours concerts are one of many ways that publishers experiment with how to connect with people, as they "furiously writ[e] and rewrit[e] plans to find that works."

The article's author explains that "for much local news, the train is at the end of the line." According to UNC Chapel Hill's research, "in the past 14 years, 1,800 newspapers have closed", and the university's research team created a map showing the forsaken areas, where "1 in every 5" newspapers "across the country" have failed. Then the article's author explains that news startups do not prove to successfully replace newspapers; Knight Foundation's 2016 analysis shows that "1 in 5 startups" grew "to be self-sufficient." Quoting Dan Kennedy, Stuck reports that "'local news looks pretty grim.'"

Struck reports on the "effects of this loss of news coverage" that "observers have warned of", including: "paralyzing partisanship, lower voting rates, government corruption, little accountability among public officials, less civic engagement." And the industry faces challenges in "stop[ping] the diversion of advertising to Craigslist, Google, and Facebook" or "slow[ing] the flight of readers to social media and free online news feeds." Because local news groups struggle, equity firms and national outlets buy out the local organizations, which Dan Kennedy "calls 'the dead hand of corporate ownership.'"

While the landscape appears bleak, stubborn reporters and creative entrepreneurs persist in seeking out ways to change the storylines. Struck writes: "some use guilt and civic spirit to garner support for news outlets", "some have found deep pockets in local owners", "some get help from foundations or philanthropists", and "some just start reporting and hope to find the money." Quoting Dan Kennedy again, "'there are reasons to be optimistic.'" The Richland Source, which Mr. Fernyak started in Ohio, maintains a free and open site with substantial, "homespun stories"; and the newsroom finds creative ways to connect with community members through "concerts, trivia nights, movie nights, and roundtable discussions", integrating the "business side" and the "news side." There are ways forward for the news operation and the communities, and presenting ways forward and evidence of progress through good management of stories helps the 21st century local societies transform.

Residents of the local town appreciate The Richland Source because of stories they share. Struck writes that "the mayor of the town concurs, saying that the news organization has "been a breath of fresh air... If the news is always negative, it starts tearing down the community.'" Editor David Yonke says that they "'do a lot of other stuff besides crime.'", and they have committed to produc[ing] positive journalism that leaves readers with hope, while acknowledging that life is not only "sunshine and rainbows."

Struck reports that the local news organizations' staff work non-stop. Tran Longmoore, a key staff member for another group, The Saline Post, works with some of the freelancers. He admits that "'[He's] not a great writer. [He's] OK.' But he was at every town function, every fire, almost every high school game, and he delivered straight reporting and photos.'" He further shares how the site "'has somebody watching local government" and "somebody covering their schools and their sports.'" As they work on the stories and the site with The Saline Post, the people enjoy the work they do.

As people in local areas explore how to respond, philanthropies and foundations make investments and contribute to nonprofit journalism. Struck reports, however, that foundation support "is typically short-lived", and the "reality...has prompted experiments with new models of supporting news" that begin with crowdfunding campaigns. "No single answer exists to saving local newspapers", people acknowledge. Some people just are "'trying to mimic the corporate journalism models that failed', according to Paul Bass"; the real lessons that local reports learn "is to get out there and do reporting again" without being influenced by the negative atmosphere. While "few of his contemporaries in local news would embrace" a "rosy view", Struck reports that "Paul Bass is doing this", and he quotes Bass, who said that "'[they]'re just scrappy, engaged'" and they are "'figuring out the business model...in the golden age of journalism'" with support from the community.

The tone Struck uses in this article comes across as honest and enthusiastic, and fits in well with the work that the Solutions Journalism Network does.

### [Using Dance to Promote SEL Skills](https://www.edutopia.org/article/using-dance-promote-sel-skills?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialflow)
In August 2019, Margot Toppen covered how dance class in school helps students develop social and emotional learning skills. She reports that last year, a teacher began incorporating dance into her classes to help special education students connect socially and emotionally. Toppen writes that "the energy of the music and the students' focus on the steps helped them forget about any differences they felt between themselves and the classmates." And she reports that the classroom strategy worked; "the lessons" from the dancing "helped students explore ideas of diversity and social engagement."

The strategy that this teacher used confirms that "the most successful social and emotional learning (SEL) programs use active forms of learning", like art or physical education to draw out students' natural abilities, strengths, and goodness. Toppen reports that despite the evidence, however, most schools do not "include or prioritize" dance in the curriculum.

What prevents schools from incorporating dance and the arts into schools? Most people do not feel comfortable with that form of teaching, however, most students find that music relieves tension and increases their happiness. Toppin reinforces the main point in the news report that "dance can be used to foster students' intrapersonal and interpersonal SEL skills." Teachers can start with something simple like a "free Dance-of-the-Month lesson" from EduMotion or the H.Y.P.E.

Researchers find that "self-awareness and self-management are fundamentally rooted in the body", so dance helps to build "emotional awareness, self-perception, and impulse control." Toppin explains how teachers can connect understanding their emotions to understanding their body through dance and music.

Additionally, the dance can help students work with their peers and use their bodies together. Dance is a nonverbal communication technique, and students can learn to bond with others in this way.

Finally, dance represents culture, so dance and music can help teachers share lessons on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Toppin reports that "by studying dance forms that originate in other parts of the world, students gain understanding of the history, identities, and values of others."

### [Why the World Needs India to Win](https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/upfront-blog/2019/0904/Why-the-world-needs-India-to-win?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&cmpid=TW&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1567699962)
Mark Sappenfield, editor with the Christian Science Monitor, asks the question, "Can a country be too diverse for democracy to work?" when covering the current political events in India. He responds, "India’s only path to superpower status lies in proving that the answer is no."

In reporting on India, the editor compares the country to China. He reports that as a correspondent in India in past years, he had viewed the two country "as brothers that had taken different roads to the present. Both were the only members of the world’s billion-citizen club and both shared an agrarian past beset by crushing poverty." In reality, in the Beijing airport, he discovered that the two nations shared nothing in common. The reason, Sappenfields reports is "democracy."

Sappenfield explains that China has done incredible work because it operates as an autocracy, making it effective. He writes, that "the Communist Party didn't need to listen to the people", and when people spoke up, the government stopped them from using their voices. India is different; the country operates as a democracy with many diverse ethnicities, religions, and language groups; representing all these people as "one voice" in such a big country can be "unwieldy." China does not believe in India's potential, so how does India become a "superpower"? Sappenfield writes that the road for India "is much, much harder than" the one "China has taken. But if it can be done, it is exponentially more powerful" because the nation is democratically run.

China was able to do the remarkable because it had the efficiency of autocracy. The Communist Party didn’t need to listen to the people. Quite the opposite. When people tried to get in the way of its grand plans, they were silenced. Slowly, the Communists figured out how to marry economic freedom with absolute political control. The result is an economic juggernaut run with exacting precision.

After Sappenfield's introduction, Howard LaFranchi, a staff writer with the Monitor, shares an "examin[ation]" of India's path to "global superpower status.", and he reports on how the nation fits with with China's work.

India and China are two important countries for people to understand in the 21st century, and Sappenfield succinctly provides a backfround for a study of the current affairs.

### [The Hopefulness and Hopelessness of 1619](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/historical-significance-1619/596365/?utm_content=edit-promo&utm_term=2019-08-20T10%3A30%3A19&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic)
In August 2019, Ibram Kendi wrote on the first enslaved African-Americans who contributed to the founding of America around the same time that the New York Times produced [the 1619 Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html).

Creatively, Kendi introduces readers to Angela and John, a black woman and a white man, who moved to Point Comfort, Virginia. "Her name was Angela, one of the first known Africans in British North America. His name was John, the first known antiblack racist in colonial America...Angela was the original embodiment of enslavement, of survival, of the 400-year African American struggle to survive, to be free of racism. John was the original embodiment of elite white male power, of the democracy of racists, of its 400-year struggle to survive, to be free of anti-racism." Traditionally, people share stories from the perspective of the elite, or those in power; but 400 years after the first African Americans moved to Virginia, people work to share stories from the perspectives of others and capture the full picture. 

As an essayist in the New York Times project wrote, African Americans have fought over the past centuries for the ideals that the country's founder envisioned but did not live up to. And in retelling the history, Kendi portrays African America in a positive light; in reality, African Americans have "hopefully and hopelessly [fought] off the giant John from 1619 to 2019 for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness", with Angela representing "the beginning of hope, the North Star essential to anti-racism."  He writes that African Americans today have a right to feel both hopeful and hopeless; but choosing hope leads to Americans' ability to live up to the founding ideals.

Not only did Angela arrive to North America as an enslaved woman from Africa 400 years ago; so did 22 or 23 others from the country. Kendi quotes historian Thomas C. Holt, reporting that "'A muster roll for March 1619 shows that there were already thirty-two African slaves' in Virginia. But no one knows when and how they arrived." After they arrived, people did little work to record when enslaved African Americans were born, and they themselves never learned their birthday; hence Kendi and other African-Americans rightfully "feel more like" this year marks "the day [they were] diagnosed with metastatic cancer" and "live in fear that metastatic racism will never go away." While ideals behind America promote hopefulness, every day, African Americans battle hopelessness; 400 years after the first African Americans arrived to North America, Kendi explains how they can choose to battle the "original hopelessness" or fight for the ideals with hopefulness.

Kendi further recaps America's racist history. Typically, people write history from John's perspective; "someone like John is indispensable", and "John is still harming Angela, brewing our hopelessness" with white men dominating government and legislation. Kendi writes, "it is hardly coincidental that this nation's first experiment in (wealthy, white male) democracy emerged alonside the first experiment with black enslavement (and Native assimilation), that the history of African America and American democracy are both rooted in 1619..." when "...John's freedom begot Angela's enslavement." And this "is all happening now" also, even though today, more people have the freedom and hope to tell stories in a new way and shine the light on those who have always deserved to be free, equal, and happy like the white men in power.

Reporting the story of Angela, Kendi writes the following: "No one knows when Angela was born. But she was probably young. If she was 19 years old in 1619, she’d have been born in 1600, the year John translated into English and published A Geographical Historie of Africa, a book of racist ideas about Angela’s race. First written in 1526, and popular as late as the 19th century, its racist ideas apparently had to be true since they were written by an African Moor, Leo Africanus (who probably sought favor from the Italian court that had freed and converted him). 'The Negroes likewise leade a beastly kinde of life, being utterly destitute of the use of reason, of dexteritie of wit, and of all artes,' Africanus wrote. 'Yea they so behave themselves, as if they had continually lived in a forrest among wilde beasts.'" He further reports how John writes about Angela and the African Americans. While racists wrote about people like Angela being "beastly", Kendi writes that "Angela was no wild best, but she was an enslaved one" when "among the 350 Angolans herded onto an overcrowded slaveship in 1619"; and men like John so no problem with making these Angolans their servants. 

Kendi covers the fact that 300 years after the first Africans arrived to America, Angela's descendents "were still mostly disenfrancised domestics like she was, or working in the fields for subsistence wages." And 400 years later, Donald Trump and his followers echo the dominant class that treated African Americans despicably in the past. Rightfully, this class of people in the world feel hopeless; but they have demonstrated hope and persistence in fighting for liberty and justice in the third and fourth centuries since their original arrival, with Angela being the first to find ways to "resist and survive", and others like Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Martin LUther King, Jr. Whitney Houston, Barack Obama, and Oal Tometi marching the whole of humanity forward into a more free state. Reporting on the hopelessness and the hopefulness, the article's author writes, "it is unbearably tough to be hopeful amid all this denial, while living in this so-called heaven that feels worse than hell. I feel connected to the hopelessness Angela must have felt stepping off that ship of terror into the terror of slavery. Then again, I know hope is essential to African Americans surviving racism another 400 years. In order to bring about change, we have to believe change is possible. We can’t be cynics believing racism is permanent, since it has been ailing us for 400 years. Cynicism is the kryptonite of change." After writing this, Kendi closes with hope for Angela in the next 400 years.

Kendi connects his perspective with the experience of Angela and the challenges for African-Americas well through the use of language and emotion. After reading his story, it's enlightening to read the following essays from [the 1619 Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html) by the following writers:

### [Lima’s ‘Wall of Shame’ and the Art of Building Barriers](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/09/peru-lima-wall/597085/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_source=twitter&utm_term=2019-09-07T10%3A00%3A13&utm_content=edit-promo)
In September 2019, Megan Janetsky reported on the construction workers, who built a wall in Lima, Peru to put barriers around Raquel Yanac.

Sharing Yanac's background, Janetsky writes that "38," she "lives with her children on the edge of the great divide [of]...rich and poor", near Lima's slums. Thirty years ago, she realized that people did not want her and her family to reside there, and people built a wall, which has become known as "The Wall of Shame", to block her out and to make the divide more real. To portray the wall, Janetsky reports: "Today, the nearly 10-foot-high barrier, topped with barbed wire, runs like a jagged scar through four municipalities. It divides the poor areas of San Juan de Miraflores, where Yanac lives, and María del Triunfo from the rich districts of La Molina and Santiago de Surco, to which Casuarinas belongs." The wall shapes the lives and perceptions of people on both sides in divisive ways.

The article's author shares the concerns that Yanac has for her children through a quote. Yanac does not know how to respond to her son, who asks why he cannot play anymore and why the wall has been constructed. The response may simply be that building walls has become common in a polarized 21st century world in which people "cut off" from "the other"; other countries have put up walls to make existing social divisions more real. Quoting Belen Desmaison, an architect at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Janetsky shares, "'It's part of this global trend of a 'wall', this trend of actually putting up this physical barrier between two social groups or ethnic groups.'"

Providing a more detailed answer to the question, "Why has the city built a wall?", the article's author summarizes that "Peru's wall was a response to a wave of migration from rural zones in the 1980s that was prompted by violence between the Peruvian government and the Shining Path, the Maoist guerilla group." Many migrants, who fled to Lima, stayed in abandoned places on the edge of the city to flee from the warfare in southern Peru; and people like Yanac were part of this group settling in the marginalized areas of the city. Escaping the guerillas, southern Peruvians built "a small shanty" in Lima to have a place to live, and for many years residing on the city's seemed like a good idea, but as migration increased, "fear and disgust began to permeate" the space. Citizens of Lima look at the poor "as if [they're] thieves", and the wall stops them from infiltrating the city.

Janetsky reports that "construction on the wall began in 1985", and the divide between the elite and the poor became more pronounced. To cross the boundary line, people, who "are 'living worse than animals'", according to Patricia Novoa, "have to walk two hours around the wall or pay half a day's wages to take multiple buses", and once they walk over they find "neighborhood[s] stretch[ing] high into the mountains,...decorated with lush gardens, pools, and collections of foreign cars." Currently, 6.9 million Peruvians live in poverty, and according to Desmaison, "the wall only widens the gap", cuts off people that the city "deem[s] inferior", and provides security to "homegeneous social groups." The wall indicates that there exists no room for dialogue between the different groups and makes those on the poor side feel ashamed and tempted to commit crime. Janetsky explains that when walls have been constructed in other places, they had similar negative impact.

### [In Afghanistan, Weaving Ancient Industry Back into Global Market](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2019/0821/In-Afghanistan-weaving-ancient-industry-back-into-global-market?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&cmpid=TW&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1566803284)
Scott Peterson, a staff writer with the Christian Science Monitor in August 2019 reported on the "soul" of the Afghan carpets that vendors sell. He shares a story with readers how the Afghans have been reclaiming their best work of art.

While nothing has changed with women in Afghanistan sitting at looms, creating carpets in Kabul, the art of weaving has become a part of a broader project to transform the industry. Peterson reports that the weavers hope to break the pattern of isolating the industry off and begin to share their gift to the world within the international market. Supporting the Afghans' finest talents and products, "the British development organization Turquoise Mountain aims to herald a renaissance in Afghan carpet weaving."

To provide more background on the industry, Peterson provides readers with a fact: 1.6 million Afghans work in the carpet business, and most of them work from home. Because of political conflict, however, they sent many of the carpets to Pakistan, and businessmen put "Made in Pakistan" labels on the products. The British organization, Turquoise Mountain, has been working to bring the carpets back to Afghanistan, and bring attention to the home country. Painting the full picture of the importance of the rugs, Peterson quotes Nathalie Paarlberg, the Afghanistan deputy country director of Turquoise Mountain in Kabul, who said, "'Carpets have been produced in this region for millennia - not even hundreds of years, but thousands of years. And when people speak about Afghan rugs, it resonates. ...An 'Afghan carpet' is a thing.'" 

Because of the importance of the rugs, the market should not stay in isolated like it has for the past four decades due to political warfare. One of the aims of Turquoise Mountain's project is to "change that equation for buyers"; other goals include "creating 4,750 jobs" and "selling $19 million worth of consistently high-quality Afghan carpets from the 15 producers they work with." Peterson writes that "despite being out of the global market for a generation, Afghanistan still holds a grip on the imagination"; the carpets possess a "magical quality" and represent the "soul" of the nation. The story behind the rugs at the looms, where women traditionally weave in a well-lit space, is a beautiful part of Afghan culture.

Sharing more information on the project, Peterson reports that "weaving producers can easily employ 2,000 families each", and "10 weaving centers" work with Turquoise Mountain in the cities. And Turquoise Mountain serves as the "trusted partner for international buyers" to support the Afghan business; the British development organization "oversee[s] production", "make[s] sure the design is interpreted and graphed correctly", and "take[s] care of all shipping and logistics." Peterson concludes the article with Ms. Paarlberg's words: "A middleman is often a dirty word in development terms"..."But trusted partners [are necessary]..."

Peterson captures an interesting shift in how the Afghans do business in the international market after forty years of conlict and "Made in Pakistan" labels being marked on their rugs. He shares well the living spirit within Afghanistan.

### [A Trade War Over History? Sort of. Why Japan and South Korea are Feuding](https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190809?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190809&id=1093889)
Ann Scott Tyson and Howard LaFranchi, two staff writers with the Christian Science Monitor, wrote on Japan's and South Korea's trade war, which threatens business globally and increases the tension between the U.S.'s allies in East Asia. How did the trade war start? The article's writers explain how historical events contributed to the war beginning.

Narrating how the trade conflict started, the Tyson and LaFranchi report on the need "to look back to at least 1910, when Japan annexed Korea." Ever since this historical event, Japan and Korea have fought over trade, and animosity between the two nations has governed their relations. The recent export restrictions that Tokyo, Japan has placed on South Korea evolves from past tension; and the restraint on the export of over 1,000 key chemicals, materials, and products to South Korea impacts the manufacturing of technology like smartphone screens and semiconductors. The trade war will impact business globally.

Anticipating readers' interest in the issue, the writers answer the question, "What is the United States doing – or not – to help smooth tensions?" The U.S. does not normally intervene the conflict between Japan and South Korea. Since this conflict influences the global marketplace, however, will the U.S. respond differently? The authors report that the Trump administration is "being particularly hands-off." According to government leaders that the authors talked with, the "Trump administration faces a 'much more challenging environment'" as the tradewar impacts global economics and security.

Further reporting on the U.S.'s role, the writers explain that the country no longer works as a "dominant power" in Asia as it did a decade ago. As as the U.S.'s involvement wanes, the two East Asian allies "turn their backs on one another to pursue perceived national interests." According to experts, international relations do now show evidence that the U.S. is not dependable, as the two East Asian countries are not growing closer together, and they are rather drifting apart with Japan "looking to Australia" and South Korea "focus[ing] on North Korea."

### [China’s Spies Are on the Offensive](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/inside-us-china-espionage-war/595747/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_term=2019-08-26T09%3A00%3A23)
Mike Giglio, in late August 2019, covered the espionage offensive against the United States, which China's spies have been waging. In his article, he asks whether America has what it takes to stop them. Reporting on the warfare between China and the United States, Giglio explains the story of Kevin Mallory, a military member and a CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, who, after struggling financially for years, ventured into the private sector potentially for better prospects but experienced trouble with the Chinese.

Giglio shares how while Mallory's private consulting business floundered, a Chinese recruitor began messaging him on LinkedIn, and conversations with this individual led him down the wrong path. Communication with the recruitor led him to Shanghai, and in China, an "espionage relationship" began that saw him "receive $25,000 over two months in exchange for handing over government secrets." The FBI ultimately caught him with secret, classified documents; and under the Espionage Act, the FBI charged him "with selling U.S. secrets to China and convicted by a jury last spring", accused him of "uncovering Chinese spies", and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. 

Other Americans have experienced this same tragedy, and an "alarming sign for the U.S. intelligence community, which sees China in the same tier as Russia as America's top espionage threat" exists. Two Americans include Ron Hansen and Jerry CHun Shing Lee. Ron Hansen, a former DIA officer, has been in trouble with the Chinese, and a case officer caught him engaging with the foreign country. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a former CIA officer, experienced a more enigmatic example of espionage, and people caught him.

Explaining the significance of these three espionage cases caught, Giglio writes that "espionage and counterespionage have been essential tools of statecraft for centuries, of course, and U.S. and Chinese intelligence agencies have been battling one another for decades"; but evidence shows that "the intelligence war is escalating" and that "China has increased both the scope and the sophistication of its efforts to steal secrets from the U.S." More people potentially have engaged in this crime, indiciating a serious problem.

In an effort to uncover crime, Giglio highlights that the public sees few of these cases. Quoting a U.S. intelligence official, he reports, "Some of the cases rarely see the light of a courtoom, because there's classified material we're not willing to risk...sometimes they're not charged at all and are handled through other means. And there are others that remain ongoing that have not and will not become public." The cases that reach the public, however, reveal a "growing intelligence war" between the U.S. and China, "in the shadows"; and as China advances, the intelligence officers grow more sophisticated with more ability to exploit former American intelligence officers through espionage operations.

Presenting to readers more details on China's methods, targets, and goals, and what the U.S. needs to do combat the problem, Giglio provides background information. While China has played this game for decades, the rules of the game have changed. Based on information from Americans legally researching communication from the Chinese spies, tactics have moved from being basic human ones to amplified ones on social media to convince a target to go to the country.

In response to the problem, Donald Trump has grown tougher on the country through his foreign policy efforts. Explaining a shift in how the U.S. must work with China, Giglio writes, that after decades of the U.S. embracing trade with China, evidence of aggressive espionage tactics show that trust and hope have been misplaced. And as China becomes more sophisticated, Americans must learn to play the new game. Giglio reports that "if America is indeed entering an era of 'great power' conflict with China, then the crux of the struggle will likely take place not on a battlefield, but in the race for information, at least for now", and "U.S. officials have been warning companies and research institutions not just of the strings that might be attached to Chinese money, but of the danger of corrupted employees turned spies."

Giglio reports further on the state of national intelligence, big data, and security in the U.S., Russia, and China, and the tactics China takes to recruit former U.S. officers for a seemingly attractive "business opportunity". He reports that once an intelligence officer in China recruits someone successfully, Chinese operatives ask the people to pass over sensitive information, and Americans find themselves in a trap. And Giglio summarizes a book that James Olson wrote to capture how China's espionage services work and explains how counterintelligence has become a top priority to combat the pernicious spying. Giglio writes, "in a sense, going after American spies and government officials is fair game in the intelligence world. The U.S. does the same against the Chinese. 'Intelligence operations are universal, with every country—other than a few isolated island-states who are concerned mainly with the danger of approaching cyclones—engaging in them, to one degree or another,'" according to Loch K. Johnson, the author of Spy Watching: Intelligence Accountability in the United States, and one of America's foremost intelligence scholars. What is the difference between the two countries' tactics? Giglio reports that "China's aggressive approach to economic espionage" differs, and China sees America as a threat; China regularly holds America's past covert action against them, and the Asian country denies spying on the U.S.

Summarizing the economic nature of the espionage and the business environment, Giglio writes the following: "The open business climate between America and China—the sort of climate that did not exist between America and the Soviet Union during the Cold War—makes addressing Chinese espionage trickier: China is both a rival and a top trade partner. The economic and research relationship between the two countries benefits them both. At the same time, Chinese immigrants and visitors to America risk being unfairly targeted if U.S. officials fail to find the right balance, which would cast a chill on legitimate exchange between the two countries while raising the specter of American overreactions during past struggles, from the Cold War to the War on Terror. As U.S. officials warn about the Chinese espionage threat and the U.S. intelligence community reorients to face it, they must be careful not to undermine the American values—openness, civil liberty, enterprise—that remain perhaps the country’s greatest advantage over China." Quoting Rodney Faraon, he reports "'The approach must be whole of government and must involve the private sector. The Chinese use and value intelligence better than we do, seeing its applicability in nearly every aspect of private and public life—military, social, commercial. We have been slow to recognize this for ourselves.'”

The challenges between America and China are ones that the public is not normally exposed to, but with detail, Giglio depicts what is going on between the two countries.

### [The Power of Language: How Words Shape People and Culture](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/22/the-power-of-language-how-words-shape-people-culture/)
Alex Shashkevich in Stanford's publication of news on how language influences people and culture. With communication playing a central role in daily living, and people employing language in "speaking, writing, and reading", understanding how people decide "what words and phrases" to use can provide insights into individual and collective behavior. Shashkevich reports that linguistics scholars currently do the work to research language acquisition and usage.

Through research, linguistics scholars seek to understand how "cultural, social, and pscyhological phenomenon" shape language, and how langugage reversely influences these phenomenon. Dan Jurafsky, the Jackson Eli Reynolds professor in Humanities shared with Shashkevich that "understanding why and how language differs tells about the range of what is human", and "discovering what's universal about languages can help us understand the core of our humanity." The article's author shares the following stories to visualize portray aspects of language, including semantics, syntax, phonetics, and phonology.

* Understanding Stereotypes
"Relatively harmless sentences like 'girls are as good as boys at math' can subtly perpetuate sexist stereotypes." The grammatical structure implies something that may not be true scientifically, and the language influences people unconsciously.

* How Other Languages Inform Our Own
"People speak 7,00 languages worldwide", each one has a unique structure, and each one reflects a different culture to which people contribute. Studying other languages and how languages develop helps understand diverse ways in which humans have learned to communicate. Each different language reveals something different about humanity.

* Language As a Lens Into Behavior
"Speech patterns correspond to particular behaviors" like buying items or using social media. Researching differences in how Republicans and Democrats communicate helps researchers understand polarization of beliefs. "Understanding what different groups of people say and why is the first step in determining how we can help bring people together."

The author of the article does not report on the stories in great detail, but the article communicates interesting academic research on an important area in the humanities and social sciences. Understanding this research will help a lot of people in our world progress.

### [What Mapping Every Nonprofit in the U.S. Tells Us About the State of the Industry](https://www.fastcompany.com/90356802/what-mapping-every-nonprofit-in-the-u-s-tells-us-about-the-state-of-the-industry)
Ben Paynter, reporting on the future of philanthropy, shares how Civis Analytics "examined the public tax filings of 353,000 nonprofits" to analyze the most popular causes, and tells a story on where people give their money.

Paynter starts the article, writing about the top nonprofit hubs with different metrics. When counting the number of nonprofits, California and Washington shine as the most thriving cities for organizations tackling social issues. When calculating the average funding per organization, however, the Midwest stands out. "It's there-in places like Idaho, Nebraska, and Oklahoma-that groups receive the most money to do their work." Different metrics lead to different narratives.

Civis Analytics, a data science firm, developed maps plotting the public tax filings within the nonprofit sector to visualize nonprofit hubs. The firm collaborated with the IRS and AWS to collect the data for 353,000 nonprofits that had filed forms with both financial and mission statements. Using an analytical method called "topic modeling", the data scientists found 15 different topics that words in mission statements fall under, and they ranked the subjects by state, and city, for the largest ones; then they discovered which topics received the most funding and who are the top five funders per subject.

Paynter reports that according to research, "roughly 1.4 million nonprofits operate in America", and they create "10% of all jobs in the private sector." He also shares that according to Giving USA, "Americans gave nearly $428 billion to various causes", which is 2% lower than what they gave in 2017 as a result of less incentives for charitable donations. The applied data science director at Civis shared with the author's article that doing this mapping helps people understand the sector's changing needs and where organizations tackling social issues thrive, even though they only have data for one year.

Paynter shares information on other hubs other than the Midwest ones; and he reports that "on average, healthcare organizations and medical benefit and insurance groups receive the highest funding per state, because some major medical plans and university medical centers qualify as nonprofits". Some of the groups addressing "the most common issues aren't necessarily the best funded", so similar people start similar organizations to end the same problem; and with less incentives for charitable donations to smaller, local non-profits, from middle-class Americans, these organizations will face challenges in the next few years. But the maps can help guide decisions to overcome challenges.

Paynter explains advance data science concepts and visualizes data well in this story. The story could improve with more insights and quotes from nonprofits making decisions. But the article informs readers of a significant trend relating to a tax pocliy in the nonprofit sector, and makes the audience more aware of information that guides the future of the nonprofit sector.

### [Tensions Continue High Over Kashmir, With 500 Arrests and A Communications Blackout](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749349432/tensions-continue-high-over-kashmir-with-500-arrests-and-a-communications-blacko)
On NPR's All Things Considered, Sasha Ingber and Lauren Frayer report on the tensions between India and Pakistan as they disagree over Kashmir. They quote India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said that the government's decision to "revoke Kashmir's special status mark[s] 'a new era' that would free the region of 'terrorism and separatism'" and turn the area into a "union territory" in a recent speech to the public. They further quoted Modi, "'I fully believe that the people of Jammu and Kashmir will move forward with fresh hopes, dreams and motivations'" as the state transforms.

Modi's statements on the government's decision provoked uncivil reactions and brought the disagreements between India and Pakistan to light. And Ingber and Frayer share that the upheaval coincided with a communications blackout as a result of arrests in the Muslim-majority region.

What does the decision entail? Ingber and Frayer explain the constitutional change: "revoking Article 370 of India's constitution strips Kashmiris of exclusive rights to buy property and hold certain government positions, allowing outsiders to influence laws and own a part of the contested land. Indian-administered Kashmir can no longer fly its own flag", and citizens have concerns that this change will ruin their culture. 

Modi, in his speech, blamed this constitutional change for "widespread corruption" in the region, where the state no longer protects minorities and low-income citizens, and the public breaks out in disobedience. Modi argued that the change does not benefit people, as the Hindu nationalist government sends military leaders to arrest more than 500 people, including authority figures. As a result of the the turmoil, the government shut down communication lines and internet connection, and this puts a stop to normalized action in the region; Modi thus characterized the shutdown as an "inconvenience." And the Prime Minister responds with reassurance and confidence in better development opportunities in the future.

Ingber and Frayer report that after Modi's speech, Pakistan "downgraded its diplomatic ties with India" through ending trade agreements and train services. And any reactions from Indians "exacerbate" the socio-political issues. Tensions between the two countries have increased, with conflict echoing the disagreement between the two nations in 1947 after they won independence from Britain; but Pakistani leaders hope that people will resolve the issues peacefully and help those most vulnerable to violence.

This report in a straightforward way shares current events in a region where conflict has occurred since 1947. Sharing how historical conflict influences and differs from tension in the beginning of the report, rather than just the end of the report would strengthen the coverage.

### [This Is What Algorithms See When They Spy on You in Public](https://www.fastcompany.com/90381079/this-is-what-algorithms-see-when-they-spy-on-you-in-public)
Silvio Carta writes for Fast Company on algorithms and how much computers know about people. The author, explaining how algorithms work, reports that data-driven systems "see a lot more than" people realize and "can make inferences about everything from personal relationships to life expectancy to 'social worth'."

Carta starts the article by summarizing how "algorithms, software, and smart technologies have a growning presence." Leaders employ the data-driven systems in many of cities' decision-making processes, and passive citizens have information being collected on them without full realization. The author addresses the issue of city-dwellers not understanding what these deployed systems know about them. And she reports that if citizens were to better understand how the systems work, they would gain better ability to "judge what data they're comfortable with sharing" and "safeguard their privacy as they nagivate" in tracked areas.

Carta shares a recent study that unpacks how algorithms operate to help report the impact that the high technology have in urban contexts (streets, squares, and cafes). She explains specifically research showing how technology "see[s]" the world people live in.

How do algorithms "see"? Carta writes that to answer this, people must learn "to think like computers", which means to "discount everything" that people "usually perceive" with their physical "senses" and "go through a step-by-step process of data acquisition." Algorithms see computationally, and in reporting on [The Machine's Eye](https://vimeo.com/346684535?cjevent=dfa78f96c51911e983d000cc0a240612), Carta invites readers to understand how computers views their physical environment and personal information. Portraying to readers how the machine gains a picture of people's atmosphere person, she writes:

"It starts from a pitch-black situation—with no information—and gradually gathers data from a number of interconnected devices: smartphones, microphones, CCTV, and other sensors. It starts by detecting and organizing information directly from the physical environment: the dimension of the room, type of establishment, the number of people inside, their languages, accents, genders, and types of conversation. It then interpolates these data with what can be found about each individual online, data mining from social media, online posts, databases, and personal pages.

Our AI machine is finally able to bring all these data together into an accurate profile of a targeted individual, inferring the likelihood of personal relationships, family prospects, life expectancy, productivity, or “social worth”—that is, their contribution to society in financial and social terms, within the context of this fiction."

Carta reports that new companies increasingly test how to build and deploy algorithms to enhance user experiences. Some businesses working on algorithmic advancement include Numina, Volvo, City Scanner, and UPS. While they have just begun "scratching the surface" of reading a nuanced picture, Carta summarizes that "algorithms can be trained to 'see' our cities in more detail, and navigate through them more efficiently, than any human", but "they are essentially mathematical and statistical models, applied to real-life problems", so "it's...crucial to demystify these black-box technologies—in order to understand and make the best use of them."

This article, while not as well-written as other news articles are, provides to readers a thorough dive into understanding how algorithms work and a video for people to watch visually how code and statistical processing tools work. Carta writes an analysis of her research rather than a pure news story, however. And in the future, with the rise of "data journalism", reporters can improve these types of articles by giving glimpses of how algorithms work to readers through embedded code and data-driven tools.

### [Why Corporations Redefine Progress](https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2019/0819/Why-corporations-redefine-progress?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&cmpid=TW&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1566317354)
The Christian Science Monitor Board in August 2019 shines the light on "the influential Business Roundtable's new purpose for corporations", which "reflects the global search for less-material definitions of progress."

The Monitor Board reports that this month senior executives from 200 American businesses published a statement that redefines progress. Businesses now focus on the social return on investment rather than just on maximizing profits and share prices, and companies look to deliver value to diverse stakeholders ("employees, local communities, and society writ large"). Through monitoring the value of business to stakeholders, senior leaders work towards "protecting the environment, investing in workers, and dealing ethically with suppliers." A new age for business social responsibility has dawned, and businesses will grow to become more driven by values.

The Monitor Board addresses that "this is not the first time the Roundtable has changed its view on the purpose of a corporation. And it may not be the last." Businesses continuously adapt and modify organizational behavior in order to succeed amidst competing market pressures and demands. However, "a July survey for Fortune magazine found nearly two-thirds of Americans say a company's 'primary purpose' should include 'making the world better'", indicating a shift in attitudes on the purpose of business.

Covering the global level, the Christian Science Monitor board writes that businesses and countries internationally have recognized the need for broader ways to measure economic progress; on a global level, people have realized that the growth in gross domestic product metric tracks prosperity in too narrow of a way.

Using statistical tools, the United Nations built a "human development index" to track how organizations contribute to social goals like income equality and happiness. And the Monitor Board reports that the "search continues to put numbers on concepts such as 'well-being', 'sustainable development', or 'scientific advancement' so that corporations can contribute to the progress of societies.

This article enlightens readers on the advancement in businesses', economists', and scientists' efforts to make the world a better place rather than just define economic progress in a narrow, self-oriented way.

### [A Future Without the Front Page](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/news-deserts-future.html)
With the recent collapse of local journalism, the NYT reports on how industry innovators envision the future of local news "without the front page." 

Steven Waldman and Charles Sennott, in sharing their vision for people powering the future of journalism, start with sharing the data: "more than 1,300 communities across the United States are without local news coverage." The breakdown in local journalism correlates with "greater polarization, lower voter turnout, less government accountability, and less trust." Technology will not offer the solution. Report for America, a program that involves emerging journalists in writing stories on "crucially important, neglected areas", with reduced cost, helps to contribute to a solution. These innovators foresee Report for America' success in providing spirited people to underresourced areas and reviving local journalism through a public service model.

Bene Cipolla addresses the issue of "what's next for local news" by covering the question, "How did we miss this?" in response to reports of "two online charter schools [taking] $40 million in taxpayer dollars for enrolling students who didn't actually attend." Without Chalkbeat's news reports on the issue, education officials would not have realized they had missed it. And Chalkbeat writes stories on local news with a mantra, "local first." Chalkbeat exists as one of few newsrooms lucky enough to have strong education reporters; and without new business models like Chalkbeat's, "covering education on a daily basis will remain an endangered species."

How does Chalkbeat succeed with a "new business model"? The organization has not done it with ease, but they apply a "local-first mantra" to everything. The whole model has been centered on this mantra, and the organization must track impact metrics, not just readership and revenue, to measure the effect of local news. Chartbeat lights the way in managing "local news that is sustainable, accessible and equitable."

Sarah Alvarez writes on the usage of technology in shaping the news. News organizations like the one in Detroit have decreased in size due to pressure; but local news stories matter to people, and without successful organizations, an information gap exists. Outlier Media helps to address the information gap; the 21st century organization has built databases so that Detroiters can access data-driven reporting via text message "since most residents don't have broadband at home or generous data plans." The organziation collects data on everyday issues like rent and then weaves stastistical insights from data into enterprise stories with newsrooms. Doing this reshapes how citizens engage with news and uses technology in a new way.

Douglas Smith, the final writer, addresses that "health local democracy requires healthy local journalism." Evidence shows that technology platforms, which change news consumption, weaken community ties and democracy. So, what's next? Smith shares how "in 2015, leaders of the Knight Foundation chose to combat this." The foundation with close to 100 local news organizations started a movement in which organizations "boil down to focusing maniacally on the needs of different local audiences." The organizes worked with their communities and saw results like new products, skills, and mind-sets "that put audiences first." Smith reports that "amid all this, local newsrooms reaffirmed that high-quality local journalism - not clickbait - is the pathway to restore sustainable local journalism." While restoring local journalism "won't happen in a month or a year", Smith reports that community members yearn to read high-quality, audience-centric journalism, so it is on the radar screen.

### [Instagram is Helping Save the Indie Bookstore](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/19/18146500/independent-bookstores-instagram-social-media-growth)
Nisha Chittal reports that countering readers' assumptions that "the internet is killing independent bookstores", data show that social media correlates with the number of independent bookstores growing. While the dominant narrative has been that the internet causes bookstores to die, with the online bookseller, Amazon, shattering the brick-and-mortar store, Barnes and Noble, research reveals that internet sites like Instagram have helped to revive independent bookstores.

Chittal writes, "between 2009 and 2015, the number of independent bookstores grew by 35 percent, according to the American Booksellers Association", and the "sales of physical books have increased every year since 2013." What explains this trend? The social media hashtag, "#Boostagram" does because it creates a way for people online to connect a physical space to the online community. After explaining how Instagram and other social media sites work, Chittal reports that users have used #bookstagram more than 25 million times. It has become trendy for people to document online the bookstores they visit and the books they read physically; the tags signal "sophisticated literary preferences." Chattal explains that during a time when people spend more time online, reading books physically and connecting with ideas in a physical space promotes personal growth, but tying the physical spaces to the digital spaces means something for the interconnected communities.

From people recording challenges they set to read 100 books in a year with the hashtag #100booksin2018 to people sharing color-coded bookshelves they like, social media drives the increase in attention to physical bookreading. Chattal highlights, "All this bookstagramming has led to a thriving space for book lovers on social media, and that’s been a good thing for independent bookstores too — because it plays to their key strength: creating community."

During a time when Amazon receives attention as a dominant bookselling business, Ryan Raffaelli, a Harvard Business School professor studies the business of independent bookstores. He shares with Chattal that "the key to indie bookstores' growth in the digital era is building community, which they're well-poised to do thanks to 'strong and deep' ties to their neighbors. 'They're seen as authentic members of the community that have been there for, often in many cases, decades or generations." Now, social media offers a new perspective on the hidden gems within neighborhoods as the online platforms create community around the physical spaces in new ways. Raffaelli explains to Chattal that "You have a new generation of buyer who thinks about building community not only in terms of a local community, a physical space, but also an online community. And a lot of the independent booksellers capture this and understand this."

Not only do bookshop customers use social media to build bookreading communities but so do the Indie stores. Chattal shines the light on "the most Instagrammable bookstore", the Last Bookstore in Los Angeles. The store "is a book-loving Instagrammer's dream" and the building's structures "make for perfect photographs" to broadcast. As people share photographs of the store on social media sites, more visitors learn about the hip place, and the store "inspires such deep loyalty" because of its culture. Brooklyn's Books Are Magic similarly centers their business strategy around social media and attracts loyal customers to a "lifestyle brand."

Authors use social media to share books and information and to connect with the stores as well, explains Chattal.

And in summary, reports Chattal, "the Instagramification of everything has been good for indie bookstores."

### [How the El Paso Killer Echoed the Incendiary Words of Conservative Media Stars](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/11/business/media/el-paso-killer-conservative-media.html)
In early August 2019, after the El Paso killer reached people's concerns in the national media, five people - Jeremy W. Peters, Michael M. Grynbaum, Keith Collins, Rich Harris and Rumsey Taylor - covered the story to share how the shooter echoed conservative media stars.

The reporters open the article highlighting the language Fox News uses when talking about Mexican immigrants. Since 2018, Tucker Carlson has talked on Fox News about "border jumpers", not refugees. Six months later, someone else on Fox News, in response to the concern over migrants, commented that people can shoot them to stop them from invading the U.S. And Rush Limbaugh similarly expressed that the immigrants "dilute and eventually eliminate or erase what is known as the distinct or unique American culture." The NYT, through a review, found that the media rarely used "words like 'invaders' or 'invasion", but the use of these terms has increased, "appearing on more than 300 Fox News broadcasts."

The reporters of the article then highlight the overlap between the words Fox News uses and the words of the El Passo killer, who wrote that in the shooting, he was "defending [his] country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion." The reporters share this because while people do not know what shaped the perspective of the 21-year-old gunman, his language resembles the ideas and ideologies that people on right-wing media platforms increasingly convey. The killer and right-wing media platforms share a "vocabulary of intolerance that strokes fears centered on immigrants of color."

The NYT uses visual tools to portray the language used on the media platforms and how they relate to the killing. The Times found that "in the four years since Mr. Trump electrified Republican voters with slashing comments about Muslims and Mexicans, demonizing references to immigrants have become more widespread in the news media." "Denigrating sentiments about immigrants" has grown common in the "public dialogue." The reports quote a conservative writer William Kristol, "It's a bit of a vicious cycle...Something is said on Fox News, and Trump repeats it, and that legitimizes it - and then someone else goes a little further." The El Passo killing took place in this environment - the environment in which Republicans portray "immigration as a menace" - and contributes to the cycle of treating immigrants as "predator[s]", "killer[s]", "animal[s]", and "invadors."

Killers in four other mass shootings have also drawn language from "white supremacist conspiracy theories" that mirror the words that many prominent conservatives use. The article's authors report that people like Lawrence Rosenthal, a professor at the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, find "the shared vocabulary of white nationalists and many prominent conservatives" to be "chilling." Other critics argue that "the overlap between fringe ideology and the words of conservative talk show hosts is not accidental", with Carl Cameron, the former chief political correspondent for Fox News saying that "Fox goes out and looks for stuff that is inherently on fire and foments fear and anger."

Through this article, it's interesting for readers to learn about the increase in the use of "invasion" and "invaders" in describing Mexican immigrants. The NYT visualizes well the rhetoric showing the relationship between the media and national killings. While a relationship exists between the two, the reporters end the article with an interesting point: the right-wing media after the massacre proclaimed that "white supremacy was 'actually not a real problem in America'" and encouraged the audience to "calm down." The media did not do this as much in 2018, but a new culture around "invaders" has been born.

### [Treasury Declares China A 'Currency Manipulator,' Escalating Trade War](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748439036/treasury-declares-china-a-currency-manipulator-escalating-trade-war)
Scott Horsley in early August 2019 reported with NPR that the treasury department formally accused China of manipulating currency since Beijing has "allowed its currency to fall to an 11-year low." Horsley explains that President Trump "has long accused China of tinkering with its currency", but this accusation "mark[s] the latest escalation in the two countries' trade war." To respond to the accusation, Horsley reports that the treasury secretary plans to "work with the International Monetary Fund 'to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage'" that China created with its latest moves. Trump had planned to "level new tariffs", and the countries dig deeper into a trade war, leading investors to let go of the potential scenario of the two nations' presidents shaking hands in their minds.

Horsley writes a short report, but he provides an overview of the current clashes between the U.S. and China and informs the audience.

### [What You Need To Know About The 2020 Census](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/31/707899218/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-2020-census)
In March 2019, Hansi Lo Wang reports information about the 2020 Census that government prepares for. For the 2020 census, the federal government plans to ask citizens some questions. 

What is the census? Lo Wang summarizes how every decade, the Constitution requires that Census Bureau sends questions to count the number living in the U.S by April 1. The Constitution has called for an "actual enumeration" since 1790, and there have been 22 in U.S. history. Calculated population numbers help to determine the number of congressional seats and electoral college votes each state receives; they also help to guide how an estimated $880 billion a year in funding is shared among public institutions, and businesses use the demographic data collected to make decisions impacting the public good.

The census that will begin officially on Jan. 21, 2020 will ask via paper forms, home visits, and online forms the following questions:

* The number of people living or staying in a home on April 1, 2020.
* Whether the home is owned with or without a mortgage, rented or occupied without rent.
* A phone number for a person in the home.
* The name, sex, age, date of birth and race of each person in the home.
* Whether each person is of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin.
* The relationship of each person to a central person in the home.

Lo Wang shares that most of these questions have been asked before in decades past. But as reported by the NPR contributor, "notable changes for 2020 include new write-in areas under the race question for the non-Hispanic origins of those who identify as white and/or black ('German' and 'Jamaican' are among the provided examples)", and "there are also new household relationship categories that allow couples living together to identify their relationships as either 'same-sex' or 'opposite-sex.'" New questions reflect a more open attitude towards more citizens.

All households must respond for accurate information, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, so census workers will begin to knock on doors in early April 2020 to conduct interviews. If people refuse to answer a question or respond dishonestly, they may receive a fine; and if people do not fill out the questionnaire fully, a census worker may call them for more answers.

With the 2020 census the first in which U.S. households can respond online, and the first to be managed since the rise of social media, the government has been working to combat disinformation campaigns. And with the controversial issue of citizenship in American politics under President Donald Trump and his anti-immigrant rhetoric, the federal courts' thwarting the Trump administration from adding the question, 'Is this person a citizen of the United States?' is significant for the protection of immigrants; though other forms tailored to specific goals ask a citizenship question. Lo Wang reports that "while the 2020 census won't include a citizenship question, the administration has directed the Census Bureau to compile government records on citizenship from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies", and "President Trump says the information could be used to redraw voting districts in a way that, a GOP strategist concluded, would be "advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites."

How can the government use census responses? The government cannot share personally identifying information until 72 years after they collect the data. They can share "anonymized census information about specific demographic groups at a level as detailed as a neighborhood", however, and businesses and government often use these data to impact the public.

Hansi Lo Wang writes an interesting report. Van Newkirk reports on the same content with a different tone in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/census-2020-russia-citizenship/566384/), and reading them side by side reveals a similar account of events. Hansi Lo Wang also follows up with another [report](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/12/748694985/heres-why-the-census-bureau-may-be-in-your-neighborhood-before-the-2020-count) of the census being in neighborhoods in 2019.

### [Here’s What Foreign Interference Will Look Like in 2020](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/foreign-election-interference-united-states/595741/)
Uri Friedman, staff writer with The Atlantic, informs readers how the incentives for foreign countries to meddle as Russia did in 2016 have increased. Foreign influence will look different over the next few years.

In opening the article with a stray line from the testimony on Capitol Hill, "Russia is 'doing it' [meddling] 'as we sit here'", Friedman covers the bottom line to lawmakers, suggesting that while they are fighting the war from the previous election cycle in the court room, they really need to brace themselves for the coming war in 2020. Friedman reports the special counsel's words: "The Russians 'expect to do it during the next campaign,' and 'many more countries are developing capability to replicate' Moscow’s model."

Donald Trump no longer surprises people as he did in 2016; Friedman writes that he has grown into "an all-consuming reality that is disrupting America's alliances, role in the world, and relationships with great powers like China and Russia." Given this all-consuming reality and the changing nature of warfare that shocked the American government, incentives have increased for other countries to meddle in elections. Friedman shares the perspective of Ben Freeman, the director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy: "The opportunities to interfere in the election are just so rampant, reflecting on the dirt-cheap social-media manipualtions that Russia made famous a few years ago, and the barriers to entry for foreign governments have been blown apart."

No clarity exists on how the Russians will interact with the American government in the upcoming years. The Russian government has repeated tactics in other countries' elections and feuds. But Friedman informs readers that "no such effort" to meddle "succeeded during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections", and "Joe Biden and some of the other Democratic candidates have pledged to not use fabricated or hacked material during the 2020 race", with Trump "similarly committed to not exploiting material stolen by a foreign adversary." Department of Homeland Security officials have taken steps to secure messaging apps and multifactor authentication for digital services. While the government secures the country, high-ranking national-security lawyers explain to Friedman that countries other than Russia like North Korea, Iran, and Chinal could attempt to engage in cyberwarfare; and with Trump's approach to leadership, he may provoke foreign actors to escalate.

The article's author highlights that America has moved into a new age of disinformation. Friedman covers how since 2016, social-media giants have developed more savvy ways to detect and disable foreign campaigns of misinformation and fake accounts. Not only has the government taken steps to increase security, but so have technology companies. As social-media companies research the cyberwarfare, they confirm that other countries have developed schemes to manipulate political processes not just in the U.S. but also in other nations. Friedman provides findings from studies in detail to explain the issue and concludes with the fact that some technology companies have not developed more sophisticated tools in the way Twitter and Facebook have done, and Facebook struggled to stop the dissemination of "deepfakes", so risk lurks.

Apart from interfering with social media sites, a Senate Intelligence Committe report revealed no evidence for manipulated vote tallies in the 2016 U.S. presidential election but provided evidence that Russians targeted systems and successfully breached state election infrastructure. Potentially countries can take advantage of these vulnerable systems, suppress votes, and undermine confidence in the democratic process. Friedman shares detailed insights from key leaders and covers "the soft underbelly of America’s election infrastructure" thoroughly.

"The influence hid[es] in plain(ish) sight," states Friedman, to close the article. Foreign governments poke into U.S. politics every day; it's not just happening on one election day, and foreign countries engage in legal ways to influence elections, e.g. through "dark money", just as much as illicit ways. Sharing these facts informs readers that what Russia did in 2016 was not a one-off tactic. Russia and other foreign countries continue to find new ways to engage in illegal measures, and they may surprise the U.S. in new ways; and while illegal methods currently live in the spotlight, other governments insert themselves into American politics in legal ways just as much.

Friedman covers the set of issues to a great extent and engages readers well with a current problem facing the American democracy.

### [Democracies Try to Boost Public Service](https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2019/0701/Democracies-try-to-boost-public-service?cmpid=TW&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1562012124)
At the beginning of July, the Christian Science Monitor's Editorial Board shared news of new incentives for volunteering that government leaders have proposed to rebuilt trust in the U.S.; the board covers this news because two presidential candidates have made it a campaign issue during a time when people fear the government failing the public.

The board opens up the article sharing a story of public service: a group of 633 scuba divers volunteered to pick up trash off Deerfield Beach, Florida. Then the board reports that politicians from four western democracies think that this type of public service can help to heal political divisons and lead to more social trust; politicians think that more young adults should serve the public.
* The French government launched a national service program for a group of 2,000 teenagers in June 2019
* The Canada government created a "service corps" for young people
* A political candidate in Britain introduced a compulsory service program for every 16-year-old
* Two Democratic candidates in the US have proposed a service program for all young adults

The board presents the trend that "for 15 years, volunteering has declined in the U.S.", but now politicians see the need to revive public service, and more young Americans desire to serve as they see challenges the country faces. Some politicians see rewarding recent college graduates financially for public service as a way to solve the student loan problem; other politicians argue that engaging in public service should become a social norm, with people asking young adults, “Where did you do your year of service?” Volunteering can help people build trust, increase unconditional affection toward others, and promote social values, and it can help the country's government achieve more.

Through this short article, the board covers a new way in wich government leaders from four countries have proposed solutions and engaged youth amidst all of the political turbulence, leaving readers engaged in ways people can impact their communities.

### [The Mueller Report: An Educational Tool for Teachers — and A Surprising Hit with Book Clubs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/07/24/mueller-report-an-educational-tool-teachers-surprising-hit-with-book-clubs/)
Valerie Strauss, a journalist for The Washington Post, covers The Mueller Report - the report on the investigation into Russian interference, in the 2016 presidential election - a report that has developed into a book that Amazon and local book shops alike put on the shelf for customers to buy. She highlights this phenomenon of The Mueller Report growing into a "surprising hit" not only in bookstores but also in classrooms and book clubs in her news story. She opens the article reporting that Walter Isaacson, a renowned professor at Tulane University, teaches the history of the digital revolution and began to use Mueller's report last year as a tool for students to understand the impact Facebook and Twitter have on politics; other high school teachers and college and law school professors have begun to use the report also in social science and law classes, and Strauss reports that book clubs, like the online Muellerbookclub.com have formed to read and discuss the bestsller.

In sharing this trend in how citizens have been reading about and discussing Mueller's report in bookshops, classrooms, and book clubs, the article's author puts in context Mueller's appearance to testify before two House committees. As political affairs continue, the public should stay informed and understand current events. Strauss further reports on how educators, who want to use the report but don't feel literate enough, can find resources that the News Literacy Project provides to help students learn to distinguish truth from fiction in the digital age; and university professors have worked to make the report more accessible to citizens. The digital, data-driven technologies, which people use to share news and engage in other activities, present a new set of challenges to the government leaders and to citizens. Strauss's article shows how multiple types of organizations have worked swiftly to help the public grow more politically and digitally literate, with people discussing impeachment, historic impeachment controversies, Truth vs. fiction shared through digital technologies, and data security issues, so that people can stay informed and contribute to a healthy society.

Strauss concludes the article with a summary of The Mueller Report. The lessons from the report seem complex, controversial, and daunting to discuss. The report, however, provides an opportunity to address issues like the following:
* Straight news reporting vs. opinion writing/commentary
* Misinformation spread through technology platforms 
* The falsity of a conspiracy theory
* Details of Russia's use of social media platforms
* How the White House misled or lied to the press

After listing and explaining the issues, Strauss covers ideas that people can think about and questions for people to ask when they engage in the classroom or in book groups.

The author, an educator writer, ties together a controversial government issue with a news report on trends in classrooms, bookclubs, and bookstores in her article; and in writing this, she helps readers to grow more informed in the public discourse and supports a country of citizens who desire to understand current events.

### [Who Maps the World?](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/03/who-maps-the-world/555272/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_term=2019-07-25T15%3A49%3A35&utm_campaign=citylab)
Sarah Holder, a writer for City Labs, answers the question, "Who Maps the Word?" in her report. Who has mapped the world across time? "Too often, men" have mapped the world, according to people like "Marie Price, the first woman president of the American Geographic Society, appointed 165 years into its 167-year history", who Holder interviewed. Even though people aim to 
draw in a more diverse group of cartographers into the 21st century process of mapping through democratized projects like OpenStreetMap (OSM). The women who enjoy mapping contribute mostly to humanitarian projects and add value to the field in new service-oriented ways.

Holder shares details about the tool that Price mentioned in the interview. "OSM is the self-proclaimed Wikipedia of maps: It's a free and open-source sketch of the globe, created by a volunteer pool that essentially crowd-sources the map, tracing parts of the world that haven't yet been logged." This new method of creating maps more easily opens up the door to anyone less experienced with mapping. Anyone can volunteer to identify an element not on the map and add it, and experienced editors will review and verify the additions. Many of the applications people use, including Foursquare, Craigslist, Pinterest, Etsy, and Uber, rely on this democratized way of creating maps in their direction services. 

While people like Price hope that OSM's democratic aims support more women cartographers or mappers of color and LGBTQ, Holder reports that men represent the majority of the volunteer community. While a "statistical breakdown of gender equity in the OSM space has not yet been conducted", Holder shares an insight from Rachel Levine, a GIS operations and training coordinator with the American Red Cross, that according to experts, women represent only 2 to 5 percent of OSMers.

Where are the women who engage in mapping? According to Holder's research, women who love mapping contribute to mission-driven organizations like Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and Missing Maps. To support the humanitarian projects, the organizations have increased the number of volunteers contributing to the work by educating new mappers and organizing map-a-thons with people from everywhere in the world. Organizations have reframed catography projects as service-oriented ones rather than tech-y ones, making the mapping experiences more comfortable for people who are not men; and as a result of the effort, a recent study shows that 28 percent of remote mappers were women, and in projects when organizations worked directly with community members, 48 percent of participants were women. As a result of women-led initiatives, people from places not traditionally involved in cartography have contributed their on-the-ground perspectives to the maps. Being proactive about including more women and girls from all over the world helps to "increase access to health services, safety, and education in developing countries" and put "childcare centers, health clinics, abortion clinics, and specialty clinics that deal with women's health" on the maps; without these women, the OSM community would continue to reject the addition of a "childcare" tag.

Mapping helps people to navigate the world safely. Holder reports that without womens' perspectives, the safety of women in less developed countries would be harder to secure. Maps consist not just of bridges and tunnels like those that men traditionally have created, but they also help to locate safe places, reveal the least dangerous path from point A to point B, and highlight other intangibles. Including women, people of diverse races, and people from the LGBTQ community in the 21st century mapmaking process helps the world "know, classify, and value" space differently. Holder covers ways that people of other races and people from the LGBTQ have been involved in creating maps less because they have not been involved as much; but the author highlights why including more diverse people in projects adds value. Traditionally mapping has been a technical process, not a community-based process, but by proactively including more diverse people, educating people differently, and communicating about cartography in new ways, the final products better serve communities.

### [Judges Can’t Decide Whether Freedom Extends to Your Car](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/road-police-power-has-few-limits/593989/?utm_term=2019-07-19T20%3A08%3A56&utm_campaign=citylab&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=edit-promo)
Sarah A. Seo in July 2019 reports on the wide descretion that officers have when pulling over motorists with City Lab. Sparking attention to the trend, a week before Seo wrote the article, police arrested and charged a former sheriff's deputy in Florida, Zachary Wester, for professional misconduct when stopping motorists on the rode; because of the wide discretion he had when pulling over motorists for traffic offences, he stopped innocent people planted drugs while searching their cars, and led motorists to prison. This crime that Seo introduces the article with reveals a symptom of a larger issue: poor rules on the road. How much power do police offers have on the road, and how much of it do they abuse rather than use with good conduct? How much freedom do drivers have?

To open draw readers into the search for answers to these questions, Seo, summarizes common road knowledge when writing that "in American culture, driving is an expression of personal liberty", "but under the law, driving is a privilege, not a right, and drivers are subject to extensive police surveillance." With little cited research or quotations backing her up, the author reports that for years, lawyers have questioned how to regulate road safety. Should police officers search the entire car of a suspect pulled over for a traffic violation and impose on motorists' freedom? Or do limits exists before police enforce laws on the operation of motor vehicles? What type of evidence of a suspicious crime do police need before conducting a search? Seo reports that courts struggle to answer these questions, and "jurists have usually punted on them", leaving serious "consequences for our civil liberties."

Cars symbolize liberty culturally, and Americas see their cars as "private spaces." To highlight evidence for this fact, Seo cites a 1924 Ford advertisement: "To own a Ford car is to be free to venture into new and untried places". A century later, the car symbolizes the same concept in a Dodge tagline: "Here's a couple things America got right: cars and freedom." Ideally, according to culture, drivers can experience freedom on the road, but because of regulation on the road, drivers often experience threats to liberty; drivers' safety rules over drivers freedom, and rules help to ensure safety.

Regulation helps to ensure safety, and ideally the laws protect drivers from traffic violations and prevent police offers from having too much liberty. Seo presents the Mitchell vs. Wisconsin case in which police ordered a blood test on a drunk driver without first obtaining a warrant; Wisconsin "authorizes warrantless action if a motorist is unconscious." Seo reports on states' laws in more detail and explains issues around implied-consent. The ultimate question is "what are the limits on the state when dealing with serious problems like reckless driving?", and the Supreme Court defers answering these questions to the judgment of the police, giving them freedom to use their own discretion; thereby, police have leeway in emergency situations without judicial oversight. The Wester case that Seo reports on at the beginning of the article represents the negative symptoms of low judicial oversight; police with leeway may abuse their position of authority. While reasoning exists behind the current legal structure, Seo draws readers' attention to why the failure of the course in "plac[ing] stricter limits on what the police can do while enforcing the rules of the road" poses troubling problems that need monitoring like the oversight that Wester needed.

### [Art Is At The Core Of Entrepreneurship, Ignore It At Your Peril](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophiamatveeva/2019/07/25/art-is-at-the-core-of-entrepreneurship-ignore-it-at-your-peril/#55c1b9e65fa9)
Sophia Matveeva, contributor at Forbes Media, covers the relationship between art and entrepreneurship. The author highlights two creators, Noble.AI's CEO and Marianne Moore, who to report how art and lateral thinking positively impact the business world.

To open the article, the author reports on how people currently tend to revere STEM, with technology speedily moving the world, and neglect art and humanity; employers tend to hire students with degrees in STEM more than they employ ones with experience in the arts or humanities. Countering the trend, Matveeva shares that the most interesting people she personally knows have diverse interests, understand both the arts and the science, and live like Renaissance men and women; and she explains the fact that art, of any form, expresses universal and eternal truths about the human condition. Because humans use the majority of products - software, dresses, watches, or a book - a narrow focus on technology or financial metrics dismisses what users need, how people will use the product, or how a product differs from others. Two people working in the business world share why this is true for them.

Noble.AI, a California-based company, makes Articial Intelligence, and the CEO has placed an emphasis on aesthetics in addition to the technology. People must experience ease when using the technology, and the product must please users. The startup recognizes the importance of humans, who have a wide range of interests, because they use the products at the end of the day. 

Matveeva covers the startup to show how art contributes to the technology-driven world and makes it more advanced. People tend to avoid taking the risk of sitting with people different from them because of fear; but when hearing only the beliefs and thoughts of colleagues that reinforce one's own perspectives, people do not hear new, unconventional ideas that contribute to a better product experience. Thus the founder of Noble.AI promotes diversity and encourages people to develop wider interests so that they produce more original work, draw connections they would never anticipate making, and see the needs of the customers. Without artistic, creative thinking, entrepreneurs would not succeed in growing a successful business; and without the freedom to think laterally, entrepreneurs would not have as much fun in the process of building a business.

The author shares the thoughts of an innovator, Marianne Moore, who created her own consultancy, Justice Studio, and paints on the side. Matveeva reports that Moore sees "creating art and creating a company" as "extensions of the same trait: seeing an idea in your head and then making it come to life." A STEM-driven world does not like people who break out of the box and do things differently, and society often tells people to just be one thing, though; if Moore had listened to the world, she would not be so successful as a "creatrix of art and companies."

Through the author's reports of successful business leaders, she shares how creativity drives successful entrepreneurship. While the world has worshipped STEM, art and humanity provide sustaining value to the STEM-driven society and change things up.

This article covers an interesting trend and captures an aspect of the business world that some overlook. Books and articles exist on this topic, and the author does not cover everyone in the domain of entrepreneurship who has discovered the importance of being creative and understanding the human condition. She also does not write about the trend in the form of a deep news story. Regardless, she reports good innovative activity in a business journal.

### [How to Save Politically ‘Mixed Marriages’ in Trump Era](https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190708#1091867)
Politics often starts in family members' backyards, where spouses, siblings, or uncles hold radically competing political views. How do family members make peace and not war in their own homes and neighborhoods? How do I choose whether to respond with love, understanding, or rage towards my family member? Stephen Humphries responds to this issue through an article covering Jeanne Safer, a psychotherapist, who for years "has received letters from people whose personal relationships have been upended by political differences", and her book. The article's author shares how since Safer, as a liberal New Yorker, has been in a politically mixed marriage with a senior editor at the National Review, she has been able to write about her experiences in ["I Love You, But I hate Your Politics: How to Protect Your Intimate Relationships in a Poisonous Partisan World"](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Hate-Your-Politics-Relationships/dp/1250200393). Stephen Humphries lists the questions the book answers and summarizes the responses to each issue.

* Why do people take politics so personally? 
Politics involves people making arguments, and people tend to feel compelled to change people's minds because otherwise they don't have emotional effect on people and feel like others have power over them. People will never persuade someone who has a different view of the world, and once people realize this they will more freely begin in actual discourse because they start from a place where they can radically respect the other person's selfhood and right to hold an independent view.

* With you and Richard, what is the difference of values between you? 
Values drive politics and world views; but values differ from political philosophies. For this reason, Safer covers values in the chapter called "What is a core value?". She explains through a story how people, who may fight with each other and hold different world views, may discover that they share core, fundamental human values in common.

* So, to understand where people are coming from, you have to have mutual respect?
To understand others, people have to understand themselves and their prejudices, resistance, and motives. Sharing articles capturing one's own point of view will not ever help to bring light to a situation with someone else from another perspective.

* Has social media made it more difficult to have real dialogue?
Social media does not support dialogue, and this is why the Safer commands to avoid social media. Social media presents someone's diary, and people feel more tempted to react destructively on social media when they see personal information. If someone has something to say to someone more seriously, write a letter, call, or go see them, and taking these things will save relationships.

* So it is possible to preserve relationships in this fraught era?
Think about the good qualities of people who hold different views, and think of people as friends as children. Thinking these things can help shine the light on what is right with people and in relationships rather than what is wrong; thinking these things helps people avoid politics.

### [What Americans Do Now Will Define Us Forever](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/send-her-back-battle-will-define-us-forever/594307/)
Responding to white nationalism, Adam Serwer informs readers that the United States of America stands at a pivotal point. Serwer opens the article by recounting the National Conservatism Conference at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C., where the conference organizer, Yoram Hazony, explicitly rejected white nationalism. Despite Hazony's efforts to denounce everything that "'nationalism' is, at its core", including "defending borders, eschewing military interventions, and prompting a shared American identity did not prevent attendees", conservative attendees "explicity declar[ed] that American laws should favor white immigrants." Covering the other perspective, Serwer shares that other attendees "took pains to distance themselves from the president's brand of nationalism."

With people voicing different perspectives on white nationalism, what was the purpose of the conference? Serwer explains the mission of the conference: "the conference stood solidly within the conservative intellectual tradition, as a retroactive attempt by the right-wing intelligentsia to provide cover for what the great mass of Republican voters actually want." The consensus regarding nationalism is that it already existed before the election of Donald Trump, and Trump renews an old ethnic-chauvinist tradition after years of [civic nationalism](https://www.debatepolitics.com/general-political-discussion/140310-difference-between-nationalism-and-ethnic-nationalism.html), or fragile recognition of all citizens regardless of race, creed, color, or religion as equal. Serwer comments that "conservative intellectuals cannot rescue nationalism from Trump" because he "appeals to racial and religious traditionalism" that has already existed and that has bounded conservative voters to the Republican party; conservative intellectuals had not paid attention, and they were thus caught off-guard by Trump; but now at the conference, they come together with traditional nationalists to engage in discussion.

Serwer captures well the full spectrum of political arguments through  highlighting Trump's comments at the rally in North Carolina, the most recent example of Trump's engagement in intolerance towards people of other races, and the arguments against and in support of his words. Many liberals accuse Trump of racism; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission categorizes telling American citizens of another race, as Trump did to four congresswoman, as "textbook racism." Republicans in support of him, but against racism, comment how "the president was criticizing their left-wing views and 'hatred for America'" to back up the Republican's intellectual beliefs rather than nationalistic beliefs, in the face of American citizens' remarks on Israel and criticism of the US. Summarizing Trump's false accusations and potentially valid concerns, Serwer writes: "Trump has falsely accused Omar of supporting al-Qaeda, of betraying her country. But when a foreign power attacked American elections, it was the president who first sought to profit from that attack, and then to obstruct the investigation into it, and finally to offer a vocal defense of the perpetrators." If American citizens of other ethnicities back up other countries representing their racial origin over the United States of America then they should return to their "home" countries. Encapsulating the politics, Serwer expresses: "That Trump’s supporters believe Omar’s sins justify her banishment, and Trump’s similar transgressions justify his presence in the White House, helps illustrate exactly what is going on here. Under Trumpism, no defense of the volk is a betrayal, even if it undermines the republic, and no attack on the volk’s hegemony can be legitimate, even if it is a defense of democracy."

Whether Republicans agree with the statement or not, "Racism is at the core of Trumpism. The movement cannot be rescued from its bigotry, and those at the National Conservatism Conference who believe it are in denial." Conservatives can express their thoughts on the intellectual ideals underlying their political party, but as long as the ideals tie to Trump or Trumpism the party remains tied to white nationalism, not civic nationalism. Does the country want white chauvinists to govern? Does the country want to appeal to bigoted behavior? Or does the country want to be multiracial? Over the past years, Serwer opens his articles with explorations of American history to analyze current events; and he argues that America has never before reached this pivotal point in the unfoldment of the idea of country.

Covering history, Sewer explains how white nationalism was part of the doctrine governing the country in 1965. Other presidents have exploited racial division for political reasons. But, after doing thorough historical analysis, Sewer argues that "we have never seen an American president make a U.S. representative, a refugee, an American citizen, a woman of color, and a religious minority an object of hate for the political masses, in a deliberate attempt to turn the country against his fellow Americans who share any of those traits. Trump is assailing the moral foundations of the multiracial democracy Americans have struggled to bring into existence since 1965, and unless Trumpism is defeated, that fragile project will fail." This is a unique point in time in which people are making decisions that define the country on racial terms; will decisions be destructive or constructive?

Making a case of multiracial America, Sewer writes, "Still, a plurality of Americans in 2016 and 2018 voted against defining American citizenship in racial terms, something that has perhaps never happened before in the history of the United States. There was no anti-racist majority at the dawn of Reconstruction, during the heyday of immigration restriction, or in the twilight of the civil-rights movement. The voters of this coalition may yet defeat Trumpism, if they can find leaders who are willing and able to confront it." People can make decisions that lead to the dream of civic nationalism; but no guarantee of people making these decisions exists in an environment, where an authoritarian president leads, and where both of the two political parties struggle to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities for different reasons.

In response to the president's "declarations of immunity from oversight", the Democrats have been shy as they have "slow-walked investigations, retreated from court battles, and unilaterally surrendered the sword of impeachment." The Democratic party struggles to lift its feet, and the party will have little resources to understand the presidential abuses thoroughly before the campaign season begins. For this reason, the country faces challenges that it has never before seen. As the Democratic party remains timid, Trump has worked to "abet a foreign attack on American democracy", "obstruct justice", and "vow to turn federal law enforcement on his political enemies"; "there are squalid camps at the border where families are being separated, and children are being sexually assaulted." Why have Trump's tactics to "rig American democracy in favor of white voters", "refuse to recognize the oversight of authority of Congress", and "assail the cornerstone principle of multiracial democracy" not called the Democrats to more active ways of responding? Sewer asks a rhetorical question, and he concludes that the Democratic party's weakness in "defend[ing] the principle that America belongs to all of its citizens, regardless of race, creed, color, or religion" contributes to the "bolder challenges to democracy and the rule of law". According to Sewer, while people do not need to agree with the attacked politician's political opinions, not defending the African-American politicians, in the face of the threats on their citizenships and racial identities, poses a threat to the American idea of a multiracial democracy that will not be defended elsewhere if not defended in this nation; Sewer ends the article reminding Americans that "What [they] do now, in the face of this, will define [them] forever."

As Sewer intertwines insights from both a historical analysis and the analysis of current events in his story, he covers multiple perspectives, defends a multiracial country, and calls people to action by saying that the time is now. While he successfully does this, he fails to cover thoughts on what will happen after politicians and citizens making defining decisions. His article well informs readers of events happening in the United States and guides politicians' and citizens' in making decisions and developing opinions.

### [Debate Deadline Day: 20 Candidates Set to Crowd the Stage in Detroit](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/democratic-debate-candidates-deadline-1417060)
To prepare Politico's audience for the second series of debates, Zach Montellaro shares the names of the 20 candidates that have qualified for an opportunity to argue a political viewpoint, in Detroit on July 30-31. For Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who missed the first debates in June but gained the tiebreaker for the 20th spot, this round will be his first chance to win support in the public polls; many of the candidates will not have another chance to debate after this one.

Listing out the 20 candidates, Montellaro names the politicians: "Michael Bennet, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Bullock, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Tim Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, and Andrew Yang."

After naming the candidates, Montellaro covers the importance of the debates for fundraising, a challenge that all candidates face; they all share the risk of running out of money, and the debate on CNN provides them with attention so that they can attract interested fundraisers and shift the course of their campaigns. Currently, "candidates need 2 percent in four national polls and 130,000 unique donors", and six Democratic presidential candidates - Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, O'Rourke, Sanders, and Warren - have met both of the increased thresholds. The DNC's polling and fundraising thresholds will rise, so lesser-known candidates will experience pressure, and gaining a national audience with a major media group will not grow easier. 

Unlike journalists in other news outlets, Montellaro writes less about the political issues and the candidates themselves, and he writes more about the reality of the political competition, the fundraising thresholds, and the importance of media coverage. His article helps readers understand the importance of the debate and the CNN coverage for the campaigns, and his article prepares readers to listen closely to the arguments on July 30-31 amdist the pressure on the politicians. Reading other articles covering the candidates' individual backgrounds and the deeper issues will prepare readers further to hear the arguments.

### [How President Trump Became the GOP’s ‘New Normal’](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0715/How-President-Trump-became-the-GOP-s-new-normal)
Amidst the Democratic party's debates, Republicans consider how President Donald Trump's provocative style changed public discourse as they prepare to make decisions that impact the future. In the middle of July, 15 days after the first series of the Democratic party's clashing of ideas, Linda Feldman highlights how a staunch Republican, Ari Fleischer, who served as President George Bush's press secretary, left the ballot blank because of his dislike of Trump's approach. While three years later, Mr. Fleisher says he would vote for President Trump because of his policies, he claims that "the president rhetorically goes too far", and Republicans need to speak up to prevent his speaking style from becoming normalized.

Everyone paying attention to Twitter from the White House has seen Trump's rhetoric, and it's disgusting. Feldman shares a recent example of his words that go too far in Mr. Fleischer's opinion. 

"The president went on a Twitter tirade against a group of Democratic congresswomen of color – calling on them to 'go back' to their countries of origin, though all but one are American-born. By Monday afternoon, only about a dozen Republicans in Congress had contradicted him.

One of Mr. Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, doubled down on the president’s point. 

'We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists. ... They’re anti-Semitic. They’re anti-America,' Senator Graham said on Fox News, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was born in New York.  

Mr. Trump then reinforced Mr. Graham’s commentary by tweeting it out. 

For his part, Mr. Fleischer tweeted Monday that Mr. Trump’s statement was 'completely inappropriate.' But he says the incident doesn’t change his support for the president."

While Mr. Fleischer applauds Trump's stance on policy, he does not support his inappropriate communication style. But with limited pushback on Trump's manners from other Republicans, is the party submitting to a "new normal"? Party leaders like Mr. Fleischer hope to reconsider whether they submit fully to this and think carefully while heading into the future. Other Republican leaders have begun to speak up also. Feldman explains, "on Capitol Hill, negative Republican reactions began trickling in Monday afternoon. The two African American GOP members – Rep. Will Hurd of Texas and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina – registered their objections. Most of the other Republicans who pushed back on Mr. Trump have been known to criticize him before, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. She said she disagrees 'strongly' with House progressives on policy but called Mr. Trump’s tweet 'way over the line.'" But dominant Republicans still stand behind Trump in leading with aggressive tactics, opening the way for American citizens to ask "what is normal?"

Feldman supports citizen readers in answering this question by defining normal. She writes, "The word 'normal' is deceptively simple. It can refer to a statistical norm in scientifically measurable phenomena, such as weather, and it can also be deployed in the highly subjective world of politics. The philosopher Ian Hacking once called the use of the word 'one of the most powerful ideological tools of the 20th century.'" Trump's way of making false statements through "misspeaking, dissembling, exaggerating in a way typical for politicians and salesmen, or lying outright" is nothing like what the American people have seen before in an era where Twitter, Youtube videos, and Facebook lie in our hands; and his "outisize[d] presidential personalit[y]" compares to historic ones, including Andrew Jackson's and Teddy Roosevelt's. Historically, more conventional figures - Martin Van Buren and William Howard Taft - have succeeded these types of presidents and shifted the country back to "normal", or moderacy. "'The political system is making choices every day about how much of this we accept,'" however, as Ms. Greenberg says, and people on both sides of the aisle, within a country of free men and women, can speak up to decide what becomes normalized within the country.

### [Onstage, Democrats Clash on Ideas. Offstage, Is There More Common Ground?](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0628/Onstage-Democrats-clash-on-ideas.-Offstage-is-there-more-common-ground)
During the second night of the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Miami, FL, Jessica Mendoza wrote on how onstage, the audience saw the chaotic, clashing of ideas, but offstage, citizens asked the question, "can everyone stand on more common ground and against the threat that President Donald Trump poses?". After painting the picture of the first night of debates well with a vibrant vocabulary, the political chaos came to greater life after the second night with 20 candidates in the Democratic party disagreeing over how to unify the party and the nation.

As the party and the nation search for a "unifying figure", candidates debated to answer the main question:  "how far left does the Democratic party go in governing?" On one side of the debate, pragmatists argued, and Vice President Joe Biden embodied this subparty. On the other side of the debates, idealists argued, and Senator Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders competed in "argu[ing] that America’s problems are far bigger than the man in the White House and will require radical, systemic overhauls of government and the economy." Creating more dissonance on stage rather than resonance, candidates answered the question of how they represent the demographics and experiences of the younger generation, and argued that older candidates should "pass the torch." Mendoza highlighted Sen. Kamala Harris, who represents African-Americans, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who represents the gay community, to portray how newer candidates better represent younger Americans. Mendoza ignored newer, entrepreneurial candidates like Andrew Yang, who has a background in working with young post-college students in startups and supporting human-centered capitalism, until later in the story.

Onstage during the debate, the American people saw disagreement, but offstage, Mendoza shared how debate attendees observed "a kind of camaraderie emerg[ing]...as candidates and their staff were forced to interact and at times even work together." Offstage, all candidates agreed on seeing President Donald Trump as a threat to the nation's health, particularly due to the destructive immigration policy; and citizens at the debate outside witnessed candidates mutually denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policy outside of the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children, a migrant children's detention center. As debate attendees saw candidates yelling "We love you!" in Spanish to the locked-in children with heart-shaped signs. Leaving idealist readers with hope, Mendoza summarizes, "It was somewhat remarkable to see a group of candidates who, less than 10 hours earlier, had been battling it out onstage now sharing a microphone and nodding together as each spoke in turn. It was a reminder that, for all their differences, the Democrats still have more that unifies them than divides them."

Ending the story, Mendoza writes that "Game 1" sends the overall vibe of the event preceding a series of debates leading into 2020, with [the second round occurring in Detroit on July 30 and 31](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/democratic-debate-candidates-deadline-1417060). Many standing with politicians, like political observers, Democratic voters, and campaign managers, at the end of the day, have their eyes and ears open simply for a "candidate who speaks to them - someone who has conviction, who conveys compassion and authority"; Mendoza provides comments from people on how the party can't be subdivided as much as they appear to be in the media when everyone grows united around the shared values that underly agendas. I think these statements ignore the nuances of the different, competing means to achieve certain ends; but Mendoza captures multiple sides of the story in this article, including pro-Trump protesters at the event.

### [How to Talk to Small Kids about Big Issues Like Border Walls](https://qz.com/1659920/how-to-talk-to-kids-about-immigration-and-trumps-border-wall/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=qz-organic&utm_campaign=hootsuite)
Normally, adults prefer to preserve the innocence of their little ones' and not talk to them about the harsh realities of the world. Ephrat Livni, a writer for Quartz, wrote in July 2019, on how to talk to kids about big news and issues because he claims that "kids hear things" anyways, through fragments of conversations. If kids already overhear fragments of the issues, why do adults not discuss the full picture with little children more thoughtfully? Livni shares information on a book to convey how possible ways for adults to talk realistically about issues with their children exist; adults do not have to over-shelter their children.

On July 9 in the US, Happy Fox Books released [The Wall: A Timeless Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43973339-the-wall), by Giancarlo Macri and Carolina Zotti, with illustrations by Mauro Sacco and Elisa Vallarino. The book, "a bright, humorous, and lively" one, "with a sweet and very simple style designed to facilitate conversation about complex issues, educate, and entertain", can help address the problems, Livni writes. Children's experiences confirm that the life lessons that books teach can help children make decisions in the real world. That's why it's magical that Livni summarizes the book's story through the following paragraphs:

"[The Wall: A Timeless Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43973339-the-wall) tells the story of a king who has not left his castle for a long time. When he finally emerges and surveys his land, he finds it’s full of all different kinds of people, and he urges an aid to build a wall to keep out anyone who looks unlike him (he is blue and others are a slew of different colors). The aid (who is also blue), is skeptical of this plan, and asks, 'Sir, are you sure?'

But the monarch says he is, so his assistant follows instructions, driving out everyone who doesn’t look like them and constructing a barrier. The king’s wall manifests in the book as a thick cardboard pop-up barrier emerging from the text’s spine. It’s tactile, tough, and can withstand the grabby hands of even the most engaged child readers while clearly demonstrating the effects of separation. Page by page, the kingdom grows less colorful and rich, the space on the pages surrounding the king more blank...

...When all the king’s wishes have been fulfilled, he is still unsatisfied. The kingdom is crowded and colorful again and the book’s pages are filled with different faces, but the wall now appears to the leader an unnecessary barrier because all the people inside and outside seem so talented and attractive. So he calls for its destruction, blaming his assistant for ever building it. When the wall is down again, he happily tells his aid, 'This is much better. I’m glad I thought of getting rid of that wall!'"

These paragraphs bring visually the news article's audience into a childlike reading experience, sharing a new way to teach kids about controversial, world affairs. Livni uses few of his own words and ideas, but he shares a new type of story for children that can help students engage with the news. I think that the article would improve with more of Livni's own interpretation and commentation; I think he needs to express a larger overarching argument that uses sources other than just [The Wall]((https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43973339-the-wall)) as supporting evidence for how and why adults can educate their kids about social issues in the media. Despite the weakness of the article, I love the topic and hope to read the book! And I hope to see more like this book also!

### [Independence Day in a Divided America](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/unity-fourth-of-july/593206/?utm_term=2019-07-04T20%3A08%3A53&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_medium=social&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_source=twitter)
Conor Friedersdorf, a staff writer with The Atlantic, wrote on Independence Day, during this time of 21st century political fragmentation. Directing words to US citizens on the 4th of July, he captures the ability of the US people to find common ground amidst polarizing viewpoints through Abraham Lincoln's words: “A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other,” Abraham Lincoln observed, “but the different parts of our country can not do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue." Through this statement, Friedersdorf expresses confidence in the solidity of the United States of America and in the American people's ability to stand undivorced; and no better day than the 4th of July exists to remind us of our united, unseparated states.

Writing on the history of the country's celebration of its independence during major periods - the signing of the declaration of independence, the emancipating of slaves, the proclaiming of common ground a decade after the civil war, the fighting for freedom by new immigrants in the early 1900s, and the celebrating of the Bicentennial during post-Cold War period - Friedersdorf highlights moments in which Americans stood united and overcame challenges to reawaken the nation's purpose. 

In the late 1700s, initially, only nine of the original 13 colonies voted for independence; but three days later, three more colonies joined in to vote, leading to solid support behind the new nation. And despite the new nation not living up to its ideals at first, Frederick Douglass praised the Founders' best qualities in his oration during the civil war period, expressing confidence in the country's ability to overcome racial divides. Although at the end of the civil war period, the "new black 'freedmen'" felt more free to celebrate the country's national holiday than did the Caucasian Americans, with the emancipation of slaves "complet[ing] the American Revolution", Americans together declared, a decade later, the Fourth of July to be a "common heritage" for both black and white, and northern and southern people. Americans continued to explore how to find this common heritage as a new wave of immigrants entered into the country, seeking freedom, in the 1900s; the immigrants fought for the barriers between newly naturalized citizens and native borns to be swept aside. And after the tumult of the Cold War years, Americans found healing through the celebration of the Bicentennial and felt free to unite around the spirit, with someone writing, "This has rejuvenated my faith in America".

As demonstrated through each of these major periods, America finds ways to evolve from a nation faced with trials into an even stronger country with belief in the words, "all humans are created equal and 'endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness'", at the end of the day. Though sometimes these words may seem like ["luminous rhetoric"](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Do-We-Here-Community/dp/0807000671) only, Friedersdorf purposefully presents how "the principles of the declaration are still there to unite us, even amid the persistent divisions that define this moment".

While Friedersdorf applies an understanding of history to make a statement and to capture the heart of the common citizen on a national holiday, I do not think he expresses the theme overarching the article strongly enough, and I do not think he weaves the theme throughout the article from period to period well enough. I do not think he successfully conveys the main point because he leaves out the many details that press on the minds of both citizens and politicians in the debates, lead to collective psychosis, and create a sense that the statement, "all humans are created equal", is filled only with ["luminous rhetoric"](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Do-We-Here-Community/dp/0807000671); and I think he loosely ties together the historic periods he highlights with an interconnecting argument for a binding belief. At the end of the article, however, I do believe that the country can put rhetoric into practice and overcome the current crisis of polarizing viewpoints; but collectively we must move from carrying belief in an idealistic dream to fulfilling the beautiful dream.

### [How Hinduism Became a Political Weapon in India](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/hindu-nationalism-narendra-modi-india-election/590053/)
On May 24, 2019, Jonah Blank wrote an article on how religion drives politics in India. With eloquent language, the author, Blank, depicts the landscape in which Hindu priests read Sanksrit chants and engage in other religious activities. Then, he states "the creed of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)" - Hindutva, which differs from the Hinduism religion; and the relationship between faith and politics drives the politics of one of the largest nations on Earth. While the author uses great language and explains the difference between Hindutvi and Hinduism well, Blank fails to depict the conflict between Hindus and Muslims, which makes stronger the point of religion influencing politics.

Moving on to portray the holiest Hindu city, Blank shifts from the main point of the news article to a specific place within the story that provides supporting evidence of the relationship between faith and politics. Describing the politics, he shares how in the city "posters of Prime Minister Narenda Modi are slapped" everywhere with "orange-and-green flags bearing the lotus leaf", and citizens can see few election signs representing competing parties. Describing the relationship between Hinduism and politics, he explains how Modi, who has just won a second five-year term, seeks to reformulate the Hindu religion so that practitioners' grandparents no longer understand their faith; Modi is using religion as a "political weapon", and while Blank still does not mention Muslims, Modi is doing so amidst great warfar between Hindus and Muslims. 

What explains the radical change? Identity explains the change. People in the country, particularly those behind the Hindutva movement, need to reshape the caste system and "decolonize" ([India: how some Hindu nationalists are rewriting caste history in the name of decolonisation](http://theconversation.com/india-how-some-hindu-nationalists-are-rewriting-caste-history-in-the-name-of-decolonisation-114133)).

Blank writes about how across all major religions, "for many today, religion is less a matter of what you believe, or even what you do, than of who you are". Hindutva translates into "Hindu-ness", suggesting an element of identity, and people think of Hinduism as more of an identity than a theology. Until now, people in the Hindu religion would have never expected to agree in how they identify themselves; family, village, or caste have rather been at the root of their identities. The Hindutva movement, which began during the Colonial period, started as a result for a political desire for developing a shared identity to unite everyone in India, while not dictating what people should believe; and few leaders within the movement have been holy leaders. The Hindutva movement supported branding the country, not indoctriating the citizens. While Modi has not always worked on the Hindutva platform, the Prime Minister now uses it as a weapon and praises Gandhi, who reshaped Hinduism significantly more than the Hindutva movement founders did, to embrace nonviolence rather than to brand the country. Modi needs a tool to decolonise the country, and Hindutva serves as that tool.

As Modi amplifies the Hindutva pitch, Hindus war against Muslims and Muslims war against Hindus in the land. Campaigning on the Hindutva platform supports the country's national identity amidst this warfare. Summarizing the identity issue  behind Modi's work, Blank writes the following: "Instead, the issues are those of identity: We’re being outbred by minorities. We’re being laughed at by the world. We’re overrun with immigrants—and you know what kind. We’re second-class citizens in our own nation. Make India Great Again." As people in the US have expressed fear of minorities, and people who are different and not traditionally part of the dominant group, like Muslims, people in India have expressed similar fears. Campaigning on the Hindutva platform helps change India in the way people with concerns need it to change through the political exploitation of religion.

To further provide evidence in support of the article's main point, Blank moves the focus onto Delhi, another city. Hindutva determined the election results in this city; and Hindutva dominated the debates. Hindutva is helping through the heart to change the country and reshape it and the caste system ([India: how some Hindu nationalists are rewriting caste history in the name of decolonisation](http://theconversation.com/india-how-some-hindu-nationalists-are-rewriting-caste-history-in-the-name-of-decolonisation-114133)). The reshaping is not on the basis of religious ideology, however; the reshaping is on the basis of something deeper than the eyes - the heart of identity: "Hindutva is not about what your eyes tell you; it’s about what your heart tells you. It’s not about what you see; it’s about how you see yourself. How you see your identity, your brand, your place in the world. Understand this, and you can better understand the changes under way in India."

### [Opinion: The People Screaming for Blood Have No Idea How Tech Actually Works](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/opinion/facebook-google-regulation.html) 
On June 4, 2019, Kara Swisher wrote an opinion article on how regulators have grown more concerned with controlling technology but in haphazard ways. Swisher explains how over the past decade, technological risks have existed, but legislators have not cared what technology companies do with sloppy management of data and infrastructure a few years ago; warning signs of "rampant disinformation, egregious privacy breaches and in-plain-sight addictive elements built right into the medium" existed a decade ago, but regulators have never mitigated problems proactively or taken steps to understand the technology. Now, once problems grow more severe, legislators and policy makers enter the scene with legal pads to address privacy and security issues, but they do so in thoughtless ways that demonstrate poor understanding of the best solutions. Ultimately, Swisher argues that while she agrees that America must regulate technology, self-interest drives the current efforts, making them reactive; and America needs more proactive and collaborative work.

The author's negative sentiment on how the time has passed for regulators to step in and that they have not implemented a forward-thinking approach makes sense; but technology companies expect to build bigger, more expansive tools that may create even more risk  over the next ten years, so it is imperative that regulators do thoughtful work now. Swisher fails to mention the work that groups likes [Aspen Technology Policy Hub](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/#/) and [The Bridge](https://thebridgework.com/) have coordinated to connect policy makers, regulators, and technologists. As demonstrated by the thought from these groups, potential for creative collaboration and positive solutions lies ahead, and their work resonates with the author's concluding opinion:

"Instead of just reacting, we need our government to be creatively proactive. Regulators should be thinking about how to use federal incentives to spur small business creation to bring meaningful jobs and new innovations to this country; how to persuade investors to spread more venture capital beyond the three states (California, Massachusetts and New York) that get most of it; how to push for a more diverse work force and fund ambitious education programs, which other countries do without pause; how to anticipate the human impact of the next group of technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics; how to create the most forward-thinking infrastructure plan to modernize our cities; and how to encourage tech to focus on innovations to combat existential issues like climate change, and food and water shortages."

On February 18, 2019 and February 23, 2019, David Brooks wrote opinion articles [A Nation of Weavers: The Social Renaissance is Happening from the Ground Up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) and [Opinion: Community ‘Weavers’ Create Stronger Social Fabric](https://www2.ljworld.com/opinion/2019/feb/23/opinion-community-weavers-create-stronger-social-fabric/). In the articles, he covered the work with the Aspen Institute to move beyond hyper-individualism and tribalism in order to repair social relationships through satisfying commitments and service to the common good. 

In a world where there's a rise in social isolation, a decline in commitment to religion, and an increase in partisan politics, people seek middle ground and alternative ways of being human. [Weaving people together](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/weave-the-social-fabric-initiative/), embracing people's deeper selves, and building bridges across divides through dialogue and creative expression helps to begin to meet the needs of those seeking substance and healing. Brooks's opinion resonates with work that people are doing elsewhere with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) to gather people together more creatively and artistically in both the secular and religious worlds; and research on [reimagining religion and creative communities](https://crcc.usc.edu/reimagining-religion-the-10-qualities-of-creative-communities/) also ties together with claims that lead to his opinion. To strengthen any news article on weavemaking, capturing the broader views on community development coming from leaders with [The Gathering Summit](https://www.gatheringsummit.com/) would strengthen the story; and in stories covering community, there exists much to unpack given the realities facing politics, religion, the mental health system, and spiritual organizations. 

Brooks acknowledges well that highly political people likely will object to his critiques on the state of society, capitalism, and focus on spiritual well-being. Recognizing sources of pushback, and what the counter arguments are, conveys to the reader that he sees other perspectives. However, Brooks remains firm in his opinion that coming together to seek solutions in unity with one another can help individually and collectively to heal within during a time of political fragmentation. Community is not the only way to support people in a time of great change, mental sickness, and divisiveness, but it is a central part to health, and other solutions, products, or forms of human expression can flow out. Recognizing neighbors as whole and encouraging them to bring their full selves to their day to day work through "radical mutuality" underpins the opinion.

It's meaningful that Brooks refers to thoughts of deep thinkers when he writes, "Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to Martin Luther King Jr.’s conception of “the beloved community,” to Alexis de Tocqueville’s celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke’s preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological" to support his opinion. It will be exciting to learn of how people apply his opinion through action.

### [Beyond Clichés: Teen Anxiety Prompts Closer Look at Young Lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives)
On March 7, 2019, Chelsea Sheasley wrote an article, [Beyond clichés: Teen Anxiety Prompts Closer Look at Young Lives](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2019/0307/Beyond-cliches-Teen-anxiety-prompts-closer-look-at-young-lives), with the Christian Science Monitor. The importance and timeliness of a national health topic makes this article newsworthy. This sits online as one of many reports analyzing the challenge facing teenagers.

Relying on insights from interviews with middle schoolers, and results of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, the report explains why more teenagers experience anxiety. Sheasley summarizes, "There’s no consensus among researchers about what drives teen anxiety, although common theories include fear of failure, the rise of smartphones and social media, changing parenting styles, and a world that feels unusually chaotic." The report informs readers about trends in teen anxiety in concise way and synthesizes data from a variety of sources; however, the report could improve with deeper statistcal analysis of data on anxiety as evidence.

Moving the report on anxiety from what causes the illness to ways to help teenagers, the words, 'It's ok to be kind to yourself' highlight how education on self-compassion shifts how students can learn to respond to challenges and setbacks. Education as a solution presented in this article resonates with the products EVERFI delivers to schools so that students can learn about [Mental Health](https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/mental-wellness/), and [Compassion](https://thecompassionproject.com/about/), a way to help students calm down and better relate to one another. As Sheasley writes, anxiety does not have to be permanent, but building awareness of challenges facing teens, as well as how best to work with them inside and outside of the classroom, helps people to address the public health issue.
