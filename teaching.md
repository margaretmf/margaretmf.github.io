### I have started reading children's books, and developing outlines for critically reading them. I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to teach critical reading of children's books to little ones. I hope to share outlines below. ###

## Critical Reading ##

* "He didn't just hear birds singing, not just a background sound of birds, but each bird. He listened to each bird. Located it, kenw where it was by the sound, listened for the sound of alarm. He didn't just see clouds, but light clouds, scout clouds that came before the heavier clouds that could mean rain and maybe wind. THe clouds were coming out of the northwest, and that meant that weather would come with them. Not could, but would. There would be rain. Tonight, late, there would be rain." (p. 25)

This one little thing." (p. 69)


* "Wind storms over the years ahd knocked down pines and spurce trees and many of them were the right diameter to use for making a raft - six or eight inches and straight.
