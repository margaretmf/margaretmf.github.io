# Children's Books #
I read and analyze children's books. I hope to develop outlines for critically reading and teaching them.

I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to share critical reading of children's books to youth.

I hope to share outlines below.

The top three books for children I have read are "The River", "Hatchet", "Where the Wild Fern Grows", and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". Other children's books authors of interest include Thornton Burgess and Laura Ingalls Wilder, and "Brian's Return", "Brian's Hunt".

I am interested in how filmmakers turn children's books into films, and I am interested in how teachers use children's books in Social-Emotional Learning.

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ##
* "The lovely huse by the seaside had to be sold immediately, and the little boy, carrying nothing but a small suitcase containing a pair of pajamas and a toothbrush, was sent away to live with his two aunts." (p. 2, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Their names were AUnt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, and I am sorry to say that they were both really horrible people. They were selfish and lazy and cruel, and right from the beginning they started beating poor James for almost no reason at all. They never called him by his real name, but always referred to him as 'you disgusting little beast' or 'you filthy nuisance' or 'you miserable creature,' and they certainly never gave him any toys to play with or any picture books to look at. His room was as bare as a prison cell." (p. 2, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "They lived - Aunt Sponge, Aunt Spiker, and now James as well - in a queer ramshackle house on the top of a high hill in the south of England." (p. 2, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The garden, which covered the whole of the top of the hill, was large and desolate, and the only tree in the entire place (apart from a clumb of dirty old laurel bushes at the farend) was an ancient peach tree that never gave any peaches. There was no swing, no seesaw, no sand pit, and no other children were ever invited to come up the hll to play with poor James. There wasn't so much as a dog or a cat around to keep him company. And as time went on, he became sadder and sadder, and more and more lonely, and he used to spend hours every day standing at the bottom of the garden, gazing wistfully at the lovely but forbideen world of woods and fields and ocean that was spread out below him like a magic carpet." (p. 4, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Here is James Henry Trotter after he had been living with his aunts for three whole years - which is when this story really begins." (p. 5, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Aunt Sponge was enormously fat and very short. She had small piggy eyes, a sunken mouth, and one of those white flabby faces that looked exactly as it had been boiled. She was like a great white soggy overboiled cabbage. Aunt Spiker, on the other hand, was lean and tall and bony, and she wore steel-rimmed spectacles that fixed onto the end of her nose, with a clip. She had a screeching voice and long wet narrow lips, and whenever she got angry or excited, little flecks of spit would come shooting out of her mouth as she talked. And there they sat, these two ghastly hags, sipping their drinks, and every now and again screaming at James to chop faster and faster." (p. 6, "James and the Giant Peach")

*"'I look and smell,' Aunt Sponge declared, 'as lovely as a rose!
Just feast your eyes upon my face, observe my shapely nose!
Behold my heavenly silky locks!
And if I take off both my socks
You'll see my dainty toes.'
'But don't forget,' Aunt Spiker cried, 'how much your tummy shows!'"

*"'Aunt Sponge went red. Aunt Spiker said, 'My sweet, you cannot win,
Behold MY gorgeous curvy shape, my teeth, my charming grin!
Oh, beauteous me! How Ladore
My radiant looks! And please ignore
The pimple on my chin.'
'My dear old trout!' Aunt Sponge cried out,
'You're only bones and skin!'"

*"'Such lovelienss as I possess can only truly shine
In Hollywood!' Aunt Sponge declared, 'Oh, wouldn't that be fine!
I'd capturea ll the nations hearts!
They'd give me all the leading parts!
The stars would all resign!'
'I think you'd make,' Aunt Spiker said, 'a lovely Frankenstein.'"

* "And as he worked, James began thinking about all the other children in the world and what they might be doing at this moment. Some would be riding tricycles in their gardens. Some would be walking in cool woods and picking bunches of wild flowers. And all the little friends whom he used to know would be down by the seaside, playing in the wet sand and splashing around in the water." (p. 7, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'And now,' the old man said, 'all you've got to do is this. Take a large jug of water, and pour all the little green things into it.'" (p. 11, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "He swerved away from them so as to go around the other side of the house, but then suddenly, just as he was passing underneath the old peach tree that stood in the middle of the garden, his foot slipped and he fell flat on his face in the grass. The paper bag burst open as it hit the ground and the thousands of tiny green things were scattered in all directions." (p. 12, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James felt like crying. He would never get them back now -- the were lost, lost, lost forever." (p. 13, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "But where had they gone to? And why in the world had they been so eager to push down into the earth like that? What were they after? There was nothing down *there*. Nothing except the roots of the old peach tree..and a whole lot of earthworms and centipedes and insects living in the soil." (p. 13, "James and the Gian Peach")

* "'Sponge! Sponge! Come here at once and look at this!'

'At what?'

'It's a peach!' Aunt Spiker was shouting.

'A what'

'A peach! Right up there on the highest branch? Can't you see it?'

'I think you must be mistaken, my dear Spiker. That miserable tree *never* has ny peaches on it.'" (p. 14, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Why, that tree's never even had a *blossom* on it, let alone a peach. Right up on the highest branch, you say? I can't see a thing. Very funny...Ha, ha...Good gracious me! Well, I'll be blowed! There really *is* a peach up there!'" (p. 15, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "At this point, James slowly put down his chopper and turned and looked across at the two women, who were standing underneath the peach tree." (p. 15, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James came running over. 'I want you to pick that peach up there on the highest branch,' Aunt Sponge went on. 'Can you see it?'" (p. 15, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James crossed over to the tree trunk.

'Stop!' Aunt Spiker said quickly. 'Hold everything!' She was staring up into the branches with her mouth wide open and her eyes bulging as though she had seen a ghost. 'Look!' she said. 'Look, Sponge, look!'

'What's the matter with you?' Aunt Sponge demanded.

'It's growing!' Aunt Spiker cried. 'It's getting bigger and bigger!'

'What is?'

'The peach, of course!'

'You're joking!'

'Well, look for yourself!'

'But my dear Spiker, that's perfectly ridiculous. That's impossible. That's - that's - that's - Now, wait *just* a minte  - No - No - that can't be right - No - Yes - Great Scott! The thing really *is* growing!'

'It's nearly twice as big already!' Aunt Spiker shouted.

'It can't be true!'

'It *is* true!'

'It must be a miracle!'

'Watch it! Watch it!'

'I *am* watching it!'

'Great Heavens alive!' Aunt Spiker yelled. 'I can actually see the thing bulging and swelling before my very eyes!'" (p. 16, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The two women and the small boy stood absolutely still on the grass underneath the tree, gazing up at this extraordinary fruit. James's little face was glowing with excitement, his eyes were as big and bright as two stars. He could see the peach swelling larger and larger as clearly as if it were a ballon being blown up.

In half a minute, it was the size of a melon!

In another half-minute, it was *twice* as big again!

'Just *look* at it growing!' Aunt Spiker cried.

'Will it ever stop!' Aunt Sponge shouted, waving her fat arms and starting to dance around in circles.

And now it was so big it looked like an enormous butter-colored pumpkin dangling from the top of the tree.

'Get away from that tree trunk, you stupid boy!' Aunt Spiker yelled. 'The slightest shake and I'm sure it'll fall off! It must weigh twenty or thirty pounds at least!'

The branch that the peach was growing upon was beginning to bend over further and further because of the weight.

'Stand back!' Aunt Sponge shouted. 'It's coming down! The branch is going to break!'

But the branch didn't break. It simply bent over more and more as the peach got heavier and heavier.

And still it went growing.

In another minute, this mammoth fruit was as large and round and fat as Aunt Sponge herself, and probably just as heavy." (p. 17, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'Look!' Aunt Spiker shouted. 'It's growing faster thane ver now! It's speeding up!'

'I see it, Spiker! I do! I do!'

Bigger and bigger grew the peach, bigger and bigger and bigger." (p. 18, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'My dear Sponge,' said Aunt Spiker said slowly, winking at her sister and smiling a sly, thin-lipped smile. 'There's a pile of money to be made out of this if only we can handle it right. You wait and see." (p. 21, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The news that a peach almost as big as a house had suddenly appeared in someone's garden spread like wildfire across the countryside, and the next day a stream of people came scrambling up the steep hill to gaze upon this marvel." (p. 21, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "By lunchtime, the whole place was a seething mass of men, women, and children all pushing and shoving to get a glimpse of this miraculous fruit. Helicopters were landing like wasps all over the hill, and out of them poured swarms of newspaper, reporters, cameramen, and men from the telvision companies." (pp. 21-22, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Hungry and trembling, James stood alone out in the open, wondering what to do. The night was all around him now, and high overhead a wild white moon was riding in the sky. There was not a sound, not a movement anywhere.

Most people - and especially small children - are often quite scared of being out of doors alone in the moonlight. Everything is so deadly quiet, and the shadows are so long and black, and they keep turning into strange shapes that seem to move as you look at them, and the slightest little snap of a twig makes you jump.

James felt exactly like that now. He stared straight ahead with large frightened eyes, hardly daring to breathe. Not far away, in the middle of the garden, he could see the giant peach towering over everything else. Surely it was even bigger tonight thane ver before? And what a dazzling sight it was! The moonlight was shining and glinting on its great curving sides, turning them to crystal and silver. It looked like a tremendous silver ball lying there in the grass, silent, msyterious, and wonderful." (p. 23, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The floor was soggy under his knees, the walls were wet and sticky, and peach juice was dripping from the ceiling. James opened his mouth and caught some of it on his tongue. It tasted delicious." (p. 25, "James and the Giant Peach")

"He was crawling uphill now, as though the tunnel were leading straight toward the very center of the gigantic fruit. Every few seconds he paused and took a bite out of the wall. The peach flesh was sweet and juicy, and marvelously refreshing." (p. 25, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James's large frightened eyes traveled slowly around the room.

The creatures, some sitting on chairs, others reclining on a sofa, were all watching him intently.

Creatures?

Or were they insects?

An insect is usually something rather small, is it not? A grasshopper, for example, is an insect.

So what would you call it if you saw a grasshopper as large as a dog? As large as a *large* dog. you could hardly call that an insect, could you?

There was an Old-Green-Grasshopper as large as a large dog sitting on a stool directly across the room from James now.

And next to the Old-Green-Grasshopper, there was an enormous Spider.

And next to the Spider, there was a giant Ladybug with nine black spots on her scarlet shell.

Each of these three was squatting upon a magnificent chair.

On a sofa nearby, reclining comfortably in curled-up positions, there was a Centipede and an Earthworm.

On the floor over in the far corner, there was something thick and white that looked as though it might be a Silkworm. But it was sleeping soundly and nobody was paying any attention to it.

Every one of these 'creatures' was at least as big as James himself, and in the strange greenish light that shone down from somewhere in the ceiling, they were absolutely terrifying to behold." (pp. 26-27, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'You mustn't be frightened,' the Ladybug said kindly. 'We wouldn't *dream* of hurting you. You are one of us now, didn't you know that? You are one of the crew. We're all in the same boat.'" (p. 30, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "They just take his word. And anyway, there is nothing *marvelous*, you know, Centipede, about having alot of legs."

"'Poor fellow,' the Centipede said, whispering in James's ear.

'He's blind. He can't see how splendid I look.'

'In my opinion,' the Earthworm said, 'the *really* marvelous thing is to have no legs at all and to be able to walk just the same.'

'You call that *walking*!' cried the Centipede. 'You're a *slitherer*, that's all you are! You just *slither* along!'

'I glide,' said the Earthworm primly.

'You are a slimy beast,' answered the Centipede.

'I am *not* a slimy beast,' answered the Centipede.

'I am *not* a slimy beast,' the Earthworm said. 'I am a useful and much loved creature. Ask any gradener you like. And as for you...'

'I am a pest!' the Centipede announced, grinning broadly and looking round the room for approval.

'He is *so* proud of that,' the Ladybug said, smiling at James. 'Though for the life of me I cannot understand why.'

'I am the only pest in this room!' cried the Centipede, still grinning away. 'Unless you count Old-Green-Grasshopper over there. But he is long past it now. He is too old to be a pest anymore.'

The Old-Green-Grasshopper turned his huge black eyes upon the Centipede and gave him a withering look. 'Young fellow,' he said, speaking in a deep, slow, scornful voice, 'I have never been a pest in my life. I am a musician.'" (p. 31, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'*Very peculiar,'* the Centipede said, '*Very, very* peculiar indeed. Let me tell you what happened. I was messing about in the garden under the old peach tree and suddenly a funny little green thing came wriggling past my nose. Bright green it was, and extraordinarily beatuiful, and it looked like some kind of a tiny stone or crystal...'"

"'Suddenly there were little green things everywhere! The soil was full of them!'" (p. 32, 'James and the Giant Peach")

* "For the first time since entering the room, James glanced up at the ceiling - and there he saw a most extraordinary sight. Something that looked like a gigantic fly without wings (it was at least three feet long) was standing upside down upon its six legs in the middle of the ceiling, and the tail end of this creature seemed to be literally on fire. A brilliant greenish light as bright as the brightest electric bulb was shining out of its tail and lighting up the whole room." (p. 35, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James Henry Trotter lay there in the darkness with his eyes wide open, listening to the strange sleeping noises that the 'creatures' were making all around him, and wondering what on earth was going to happen to him in the morning. Already, he was beginning to like his new friends very much. They were not nearly as terrible as they looked. In fact, they weren't really terrible at all. They seemed extremely kind and helpful in spite of all the shouting and arguing that went on between them." (p. 37, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The Ladybug, who was obviously a kind and gentle creature, came over and stood beside him. 'In case you don't know it,' she said, 'we are about to depart forever from the top of this ghastly hill that we've all been living on for so long. We are about to roll away inside this great big beautiful peach to a land of...of...of...to a land of--'" (p. 38, "James and the Giant Peach")

"'Never you mind,' said the Ladybug. 'But nothing could be worse than this desolate hilltop and those two repulsive aunts of yours --'" (p. 38, "James and the Giant Peach")

*"'We may see a Creature with forty-nine heads
Who lives in the desolate snow,
And whenever he catches a cold (which he dreads)
He has forty-nine noses to blow.'" 

*"'We may see the venomous Pink-Spotted Scrunch
Who can chew up a man with one bite.
It likes to eat five of them roasted for lunch
And eighteen for its supper at night.'"

*"'We may see a Dragon, and nobody knows
That we won't see a Unicorn there.
We may see a terrible Monster with toes
Growing out of the tufts of his hair.'"

*"'We may see the sweet little Biddy-Brigh Hen
So playful, so kind, and well-bred;
And such beautiful eggs! You just boil them and then
They explode and they blow off your head.'"

*"'A Gnu and Gnocerous surely you'll see
And that gnormous and gnorrible Gnat
Whose sting when it stings you goes in at the knee
And comes out through the top of your hat.'"

*"'We may even get lost and be frozen by frost.
We may die in an earthquake or tremor.
Or nastier still, we may even be tossed.
On the horns of a furious Dilemma.'"

*"'But who cares! Let us go from this horrible hill!
Let us roll! Let us bowl! Let us punge!
Let's go rolling and bowling and spinning until
We're away from old Spiker and Sponge!'" 

* "Outisde in the garden, at that very moment, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker had just taken their places at the front gate, each with a bunch of tickets in her hand, and the first stream of early-morning sightseers was visible in the distance climbing up the hill to view the peach." (p. 41, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The noise, of course, had been caused by the giant peach crashing through the fence that surrounded it, and now, gathering speed every second, it came rolling across the garden toward the place where Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker were standing.

They gaped. They screamed. They started to run. They panicked. They both got in each other's away. They began pushing and jostling, and each of them was thinking only about saving herself. Aunt Sponge, the fat one, tripped over a box that she'd brought along to keep the money in, and fell flat on her face. Aunt Spiker immediately tripped over Aunt Sponge and came down on top of her. They both lay on the ground, fighting and clawing and yelling and struggling frantically to get up again, but before they could do this, the mighty peach was upon them." (p. 42, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The noise, of course, had been caused by the giant peach crashing through the fence that surrounded it, and now, gathering speed every second, it came rolling across the garden toward the place where Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker were standing." (p. 42, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "And now the pach had broken out of the garden and was over the edge of the hill, rolling and bouncing down the steep slope at a terrific pace. Faster and faster and faster it went, and the crowds of people who were climbing up the hill suddenly caught sight of this terrible monster plunging down upon them and they screamed and scattered to right and left as it went hurtling by." (p. 43, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "But the peach rushed on across the countryside - on and on and on, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Cowsheds, stables, pigsties, barns, bungalows, hayricks, anything that got in its way went toppling over like a nine-pin. An old man sitting quietly beside a stream had his fishing rod whisked out of his hands as it went dashing by, and a woman called Daisy Entwistle was standing so close to it as it passed that she had the skin taken off the tip of her long nose." (p. 45, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Everything and all of them were being rattled around like pease inside an enormous rattle that was being rattled by a mad giant who refused to stop. To make it worse, something went wrong with the Glow-worm's lighting system, and the room was in pitchy darkness. There were screams and yells and curses and cries of pain, and everything kep going round and round, and once James made a frantic grab at some thick bars sticking out from the wall only to find that they were a couple of the Centipede's legs. 'Let go, you idiot!' shouted the Centipede kickhing himself free, and James was promptly flung across the room into the Old-Green Grasshopper's honry lap. Twice he got tangled up in Miss Spider's legs (a horrid business), and toward the end, the poror Earthwrom, who was cracking himself like a whip every time he flew through the air from one side of the room to the other, coiled himself around James's body in a panic and refused to unwind." (p. 47, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "A minute later, they were out in the open, standing on the very top of the peach, near the stem, blinking their eyes in the strong sunlight and peering nervously around.

'What happened?'

'Where are we?'

'But this is *impossible*!'

'Unbelievable!'

'Terrible!'

'I *told* you we were bobbing up and down,' the Ladybug said.

'We're in the middle of the sea!' cried James.

And indeed they were. A strong current and a high wind had carried the peach so quickly away from the shore that already the land was out of sight. All around them lay the vast black ocean, deep and hungry. Little waves were bibbling against the sides of the peach" (pp. 50-51, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'The boy is quite right,' the Old-Green-Grasshopper said. 'We are floating beatuifully. Now we must all sit down and keep perfectly calm. Everything will be all right in the end.'" (p. 52, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'Of course I'm right,' the Earthworm said. 'And we're not likely to find anything around here either. We shall get thinner and thinner and thirstier and thirstier, and we shall all die a slow and grisly death from starvation. I am dying already. I am slowly shriveling up for want of food. Personally, I would rather drown.'" (p. 52, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'What are you looking so worried about, Earthworm?' the Centipede asked. 'What's the problem?'

'The problem is...' the Earthworm siad, 'the problem is...well, the problem is that there is no problem!'" (p. 54, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Earthworm gives life to save friends..." (p. 64, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "It was very quiet now on the top of the peach. There was nobody in sight - nobody except the Earthworm." (p. 66, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The giant peach rose up dripping out of the water and began climbing toward the heavens." (p. 69, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The Old-Green-Grasshopper kept hopping, higher and higher in the air. The Ladybug rushed over and shook James warmly by the hand. The Glow-worm, who at the best of times was a very shy and silent creature, sat glowing with pleasure near the tunnel entrance. Even the Silkworm, looking white and thing and completely exhausted, came creeping out of the tunnel to watch this miraculous ascent." (p. 71, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "Miss Spider clambered back onto the deck with a pleased but also rather puzzled look on her face. 'You won't believe this,' she said, 'but actually there's hardly any damage down there at all! The peach is almost untouched! There are just a few tiny pieces out of it here and there, but nothing more.'" (p. 72, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'Oh, hooray!' He's going to play for us!' they cried, and immediately the whole company sat themselves down in a circle around the Old Green Musician - and the concert began." (p. 76, "James and the Giant Peach")

"From the moment that the first note was struck, the audience became completely spellbound. And as for James, never had he heard such beautiful music as this. In the garden at home on summer evenings, he had listened many times to the sound of grasshoppers chirping in the grass, and he had always liked the noise that they made. But this was a different kind of noise altogether. This was real music - chords, harmonies, tunes, and all the rest of it." (p. 76, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The bow of the violin, the part that moved, was his back leg. The strings of the violin, the part that made the sound, was the edge of his wing." (p. 77, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'Well,' the Earthwrom said. 'Next time you stand in a field or in a garden and look around you, then just remember this: that every grain of soil upon the surface of the land, every tiny little bit of soil that you can see, has actually passed through the body of an Earthworm during the last few years! Isn't that wonderful?'" (p. 80, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'We do it for the farmers. It makes the soil nice and light and crumbly so that things will grow well in it. If you really want to know, the farmers couldn't do without us. We are essential. We are vital. So it is only natural that the farmer should love us. He loves us even more, I believe, than he loves the Ladybug.'" (p. 80, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "'My dear boy,' the Old-Green-Grasshopper said, patting James on the back. 'I do congratulate you.'"

"'My boots!' cried the Centipede. 'Just look at my precious boots! They are ruined by the water!'

'Be quiet!' the Earthworm said. 'You are lucky to be alive.'

'Are we still going up and up?' asked James.

'We certainly are,' answered the Old-Green-Grasshopper.

'And it's beginning to get dark.'

'I know. It'll soon be night.'" (p. 86, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "James Henry Trotter and his companions crouched close together on top of the peach as the night began closing in around them. Clouds like moutnains towered high above their heads on all sides, mysterious, menacing, overwhelming. Gradually it grew darker and darker, and then a pale three-quarter moon came up over the tops of the clouds and cast an eerie light over the whole scene. The giant peach swayed gently from side to side as it floated along, and the hundreds of silky white strings going upward from its stem were beautiful in the moonlight. So also was the great flock of seagulls overhead." (p. 86, "James and the Giant Peach")

* "The Centipede roared with laughter. 'Those imbeciles couldn't hear anything!' he cried. 'They're deaf as doorknobs! You watch!' And before anyone could stop him, he had cupped his front feet to his mouth and was yelling at the Cloud-Men as loud as he could. 'Idiots!' he yelled. 'Nincompoops! Half-wits! Blunderheads! Asses! What on earth do you think you're doing over there!'" (p. 89, "James and the Giant Peach")

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ##
* "If you want to find Cherry-Tree Lane all you have to do is ask the Policeman at the cross-roads. He will push his helmet slightly to one side, scratch his head thoughtfully, ad then he will point his huge white-gloved finger and say: 'First to your right, second to your left, sharp right again, and you're there. Good morning.'" (p. 1, "Mary Poppins")

"And sure enough, if you follow his directions exactly, you will be there - right in the middle of Cherry-Tree Lane, where the houses run down one side and the Park runs down the other and the cherry-trees go dancing right down the middle." (p. 1, "Mary Poppins")

* "Then I should wait and watch for the Nannies to queue up outside the front gate, and I should get very cross with them for holding up the traffic and making it necessary for me to give the policeman a shilling for putting him to so much trouble. Now I must be off. Whew, it's as cold as the North Pole. Which way is the wind blowing?'" (p. 3, "Mary Poppins")

* "And as he said that, Mr. Banks popped his head out of the window and looked down the Lane to Admiral Bloom's house at the corner. This was the grandest house in the Lane, and the Lane was very proud of it because it was built exactly like a ship. There was a flagstaff in the garden, and on the roof was a gilt weathercock shaped like a telescope." (p. 3, "Mary Poppins")

* "Now, the City was a place where Mr. Banks went every day - except Sundays, of course, and Bank Holidays - and while he was there he sat on a large chair in front of a large desk and made money. All day long he worked, cutting out pennies and shillings and half-crowns and threepenny-bits. And he brought them home with him in his little black bag. Sometimes he would give some to Jane and Michael for their money-boxes, and when he couldn't spare any he would say, 'The Bank is broken,' and they would know he hadn't made much money that day." (p. 3, "Mary Poppins")

* "They were glad Katie Nanna had gone, for they had never liked her. She was old and fat and smelt of barley-water. Anything, they thought, would be better than Katie anna - if not *much* better." (p. 4, "Mary Poppins")

* "'The nursury is upstairs --' And sh led the way towards the staircase, talking all the time, without stopping once. And because she was doing that Mrs. Banks did not notice what was happening behind her, but Jane and Michael, watching from the top landing, had an excellent view of the extraordinary thing the visitor now did." (p. 8, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins regarded them steadily, looking from one to the other as though she were making up her mind whether she liked them or not. 'Will we do?' said Michael. 'Michael, don't be naughty,' said his Mother. Mary Poppins continued to regard the four children searchingly. Then, with a long, loud sniff that seemed to indicate that she had made up her mind, she said: " (p. 9, "Mary Poppins")

* "By this time the bag was open, and Jane and Michael were more than surprised to find it was completely empty.

'Why,' said Jane, 'there's nothing in it!'

'What do you mean - nothing?' demanded Mary Poppins, drawing herself up and looking as though she had been insulted. 'Nothing in it, did you say?'

And with that she took out from the empty bag a starched white apron and tied it round her waist. Next she unpacked a large cake of Sunlight Soap, a toothbrush, a packet of hairpins, a bottle of scent, a small folding armchair and a box of throat lozenges.

Jane and Michael stared.

'But I *saw*,' whispered Michael. 'It *was* empty.'

'Hush!' said Jane, as Mary Poppins took out a large bottle labelled 'One Tea-Spoon to be Taken at Bed-Time.'

A spoon was attached to the neck of the bottle, and into this Mary Poppins poured a dark crimson fluid.

'Is that your medicine?' enquired Michael, looking very interested.

'No, yours,' said Mary Poppins, holding out the spoon to him. Michael stared. He wrinkled up his nose. He began to protest.

'I don't want it. I don't need it. I won't!'" (pp. 10-11, "Mary Poppins")

"But Mary Poppin's eyes were fixed upon him, and Michael suddenly discovered that you could not look at Mary Poppins and disobey here. There was soemthing strange and extraordinary about her - something that was frightening and at the same time most exciting. The spoon came nearer. He held his breath, shut his eyes and gulped. A delicious taste ran round his mouth. He turned his tongue in it. He swallowed, and a happy smile ran round his face. (p. 11, "Mary Poppins")

"'Strawberry ice,' he said ecstatically. 'More, more, more!'

But Mary Poppins, her face as stern as before, was pouring out a dose for Jane. It ran into the spoon, silvery, greeny, yellowy. Jane tasted it.

'Lime-juice cordial,' she said, sliding her tongue deliciously over her lips. But when she saw Mary Poppins moving towards the Twins with the bottle Jane rushed at her." (p. 11, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins, however, took no notice, but with a warning, terrible glance at Jane, tipped the spoon towards John's mouth. He lapped at it eagerly, and by the few drops that were split on his bib, Jane and Michael could tell that the substance in the spoon this time was milk. Then Barbara had her share, and she gurgled and licked the spoon twice.

Mary Poppins then poured out another dose and solemnly took it herself." (p. 12, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Now', she said, 'spit-spot into bed.' And she began to undress them. They noticed that whereas buttons and hooks had needed all sorts of coaxing from Katie Nanna for Mary Poppins they flew apart almost at a look. In less than a minute they found themselves in bed and watching, by the dim light from the night-light, the rest of Mary Poppins's unpacking being performed.

Fromt he carpet bag she took out seven flannel nightgowns, four cotton ones, a pair of boots, a set of dominoes, two bathing-caps and a postcard album. Last of all came a folding camp-bedstead with blankets and eiderdown complete, and this she set down between John's cot and Barbara's." (p. 12, "Mary Poppins")

* "But they knew, both of them, that something strange and wonderful had happened at Number Seventeen, Cherry-Tree Lane." (p. 13, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins stared from him to Jane in silence. Then she sniffed." (p. 13, "Mary Poppins")

* "And that is how Mary Poppins came to live at Number Seventeen, Cherry-Tree Lane. And although they sometimes found themselves wishing for the quieter, more ordinary days when Katie Nanna ruled the household, everybody, on the whole, was glad of Mary Poppins's arrival. Mr. Banks was glad because, as she arrived by herself and did not hold up the traffic, he had not had to tip the Policeman. Mrs. Banks was glad because she was so fashionable that she didn't believe in giving references. Mrs. Brill and Ellen were glad because they could drink strong cups of tea all day in the kitchen and no longer needed to preside at nursuery suppers." (p. 14, "Mary Poppins")

* "Now, the Match-Man had two professions. He not only sold matches like any ordinary match-man, but he drew pavement pictures as well. He did these things turn-about according to the weather. If it was wet, he sold matches because the rain would have washed away his pictures if he had painted them. If it was fine, he was on his knees all day, making pictures in coloured chalks on the side-walks, and doing them so quickly that often you would find he had painted up one side of a street and down the other almost before you'd had time to come round the corner." (pp. 16-17, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins looked down at her feet and rubbed the toe of one shoe along the pavement two or three times. Then she smiled at the shoe in such a way that the shoe knew quite well that the smile wasn't meant for it." (pp. 17-18, "Mary Poppins")

* "Bert could not say anything for a moment, for his mouth had fallen open and he was staring at her with round eyes. Then he gulped and said: 'Golly!'" (p. 20, "Mary Poppins")

* "That was all. But he said it in such a way and stared so steadily and so delightedly at her that she took a little mirror out of her bag and looked at herself in it.

She, too, she discovered, had changed. Round her shoulders hung a cloak of lovely artificial silk with watery patterns all over it, and the tickling feeling at the back of her neck came, the mirror told her, from a long curly feather that swept down from the brim of her hat. Her best shoes had disappeared, and in their place were others much finer and with large diamond buckles shining upon them. She was still wearing the white gloves and carrying the umbrella." (pp. 20-21, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins, thoroughly surprised, sat down with a plop upon one of the little green chairs that stood round the table. The Match-Man, staring, collapsed on to another." (p. 21, "Mary Poppins")

* "The Merry-go-Round was just slowing down as they approached it. They leapt upon it, Mary Poppins on a black horse and the Match-Man on a grey. And when the music started again and they began to move, they rode all the way to Yarmouth and back, because that was the place they both wanted most to see." (p. 24, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane and Michael followed Mary Poppins upstairs. Mary Poppins knocked at the door.

'Come in! Come in! And welcome!' called a loud, cheery voice from inside. Jane's heart was pitter-pattering with excitement.

'He is in!' she signalled to Michael with a look.

Mary Poppins opened the door and pushed them in front of her. A large cheerful room lay before them. At one end of it a fire was burning brightly and in the centre stood an enormous table laid for tea - four cups and saucers, piles of bread and butter, crumpets, coconut cakes and a large plum cake with pink icing." (p. 29, "Mary Poppins")

* "And as she spoke she looked up at the ceiling. Jane and Michael looked up too and to their surprise saw a round, fat, bald man who was hanging in the air without holding on to anything. Indeed, he appear to be *sitting* on the air, for his legs were crossed and he had just put down the newspaper which he had been reading when they came in.

"My dear,' said Mr. Wigg, smiling down at the children, and looking apologetically at Mary Poppins, 'I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid it is my birthday.'

'Tch, tch, tch!' said Mary Poppins.

'I only remembered last night and there was no time then to send you a postcard asking you to come another day. Very distressing, isn't it?' he said, looking down at Jane and Michael.

'I can ee you're rather surprised,' said Mr. Wigg. And indeed, their mouths were so wide open with astonishment that Mr. Wigg, if he had been a little smaller, might almost have fallen into one of them.

'I'd better explain, I think,' Mr. Wigg went on calmly. 'You see, it's this way. I'm a cheerful sort of man and very disposed to laughter. You wouldn't believe, either of you, the number of things that strike me as being funny. I can laugh at pretty nearly everything, I can.'

And with that Mr. Wigg began to bob up and down, shaking with laughter at the thought of his own cheerfulness." (p. 30, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Well, you see, if I laugh on that particular day I become so filled with Laughing Gas that I simply can't keep on the ground. Even if I smile it happens. The first funny thought, and I'm up like a balloon. And until I can think of something serious I can't get down again.' Mr. Wigg began to chuckle at that, but he caught sight of Mary Poppins's face and stopped the chuckle, and continued:" (p. 31, "Mary Poppins")

* "you two and Mary P. to visit me. Oh, Lordy, Lordy, don't make me laught, I beg of you --' But although Jane and Michael had done nothing very amusing, except to stare at him in astonishment, Mr. Wigg began to laugh again loudly, and as he laughed he went bouncing and bobbing about in the air, with the newspaper rattling his hand and his spectacles half on and half off his nose.

He looked so comic, floundering in the air like a great human bubble, clutching at the ceiling sometimes and sometimes at the gas-bracket as he passed it, that Jane and Michael, though they were trying hard to be polite, just couldn't help doing what they did. They laughed. *And* they laughed. They shut their mouths tight to prevent the laughter escaping, but that didn't do any good. And presently they were rolling over and over on the floor, sqeualing and shrieking with laughter.

Jane did not reply, for a curious thing was happening to her. As she laughed she felt herself growing lighter and lighter, just as though she were being pumped full of air. It was a curious and delicious feeling and it made her want to laugh all the more. And then suddenly, with a bouncing bound, she felt herself jumping through the air. Michael, to his astonishment, saw her go soaring up through the room. With a little bump her head touched the ceiling and then she went bouncing along it till she reached Mr. Wiggs." (pp. 32-33, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Ah, she doesn't need to,' said Mr. Wigg sighing. 'She can come up if she wants to, even without laughing - and she knows it.' And he looked mysteriously and secretly at Mary Poppins as she stood down there on the hearth-rug.

'Well,' said Mary Poppins, 'it's all very silly and undignified, but, since you're all up there and don't seem able to get down, I supposed I'd better come up, too.'

With that, to the surprise of Jane and Michael, she put her hands down at her sides and without a laugh, without even the faintest glimmer of a smile, she shot up through the air and sat down beside Jane.

'How many times, I should like to know,' she said snappily, 'have I told you to take off your coat when you come into a hot room?' And she unbuttoned Jane's coat and laid it neatly on the air beside the hat.

'That's right, Mary, that's right,' said Mr. Wigg contentedly, as eh leant down and put his spectactles on the mantelpiece. 'Now we're all comfortable --'

'There's comfort *and* comfort,' sniffed Mary Poppins.

'And we can have tea,' Mr. Wigg went on, apparently not noticing her remark. And then a startled look came over his face.

'My goodness!' he said. 'How dreadful! I've just realised - that table's down there and we're up hre. What *are* we going to do? We're ehre and it's there. It's an awful tragedy - awful! But oh, it's terribly comic!' And he hid his face in his handkerchief and laughed loudly into it. Jane and Michael though they did not want to miss the crumpets and the cakes, couldn't help laughing too, because Mr. Wigg's mirth was so infectous.

Mr. Wigg dried his eyes." (p. 35, "Mary Poppins")

* "Presently it was swaying dangerously, and then with a rattle of china and with cakes lurching off their plates on tot he cloth, the table came soaring through the room, gave one graceful turn, and landed beside them so that Mr. Wigg was at its head." (pp. 36-37, "Mary Poppins")

* "'I hope, young man', she retorted, 'I have more respect for myself than to go bouncing about in the air like a rubber ball on the end of a bat. I'll stay on my own feet, thank you, or my name's not Amy Persimmon, and --oh dear, oh *dear*, my goodness, oh DEAR - what is the matter? I can't walk, I'm going, I -- oh, help, HELP!'

For Miss Persimmon, quite against her will, was off the ground and was stumbling through the air, rolling from side to side like a very thin barrel, balancing the tray in her hand. She was almost weeping with distress as she arrived at the table and put down her jug of hot water.

'Thank you,' said Mary Poppins in a calm, very polite voice.

Then Miss Persimmon turned and went wafting down again, murmuring as she went: 'So undignified - and me a well-behaved, steady-going woman. I must see a doctor --'" (p. 39, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins sat between them, offended and silent, and presently, because they were very tired, they crept closer to her and leant up against her sides and fell asleep, still wondering..." (p. 43, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Well, if you know, why bother to ask me?' said Mary Poppins sniffing. 'I'm no dictionary.'" (p. 50, "Mary Poppins")

* "Just as they were about to cross the road to their own house, they heard loud cries coming from Next Door, and there they saw a curious sight. Miss Lark's two maids were rushing wildly about the garden, looking under bushes and up in to the trees as people do who have lost their most valuable possession. And there was Robertson Ay, from Number Seventeen, busily wasting his time by poking at the gravel on Miss Lark's path with a broom as though he expected to find the missing treasure under a pebble." (p. 51, "Mary Poppins")

* "She sobbed a moment into her handkerchief, then she blew her nose and said:" (p. 55, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane, with her head tied up in Mary Poppins's bandanna handkerchief, was in bed with earache.

'What does it feel like?' Michael wanted to know.

'Like guns going off inside my head,' said Jane.

'Cannons?'

'No, pop-guns.'

'Oh,' said Michael. And he almost wished he could have earache, too. It sounded so exciting.

'Shall I tell you a story out of one of the books?' said Michael, going to the bookshelf.'" (p. 57, "Mary Poppins")

* "So Michael sat all the afternoon on the window-seat telling her everything that occurred in the Lane. And sometimes his accounts were very dull and sometimes very exciting.

'There's Admiral Boom!' he said once. 'He has come out of his gate and is hurrying down the Lane. Here he comes. His nose is redder than ever and he's wearing a tophat. Now he is passing Next Door --'" (p. 58, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Certainly not,' she said, turning to Jane and Michael. 'It's not funny at all. I know that cow. She was a great friend of my Mother's and I'll thank you to speak politely of her.' She smoothed her apron and looked at them both very severely." (p. 59, "Mary Poppins")

* "'It was long ago,' said Mary Poppins, in a brooding, story-telling voice. She paused, as though she were remembering events that happened hundreds of years before that time. Then she went on dreamily, still gazing into the middle of the room, but without seeing anything.

The Red Crow - that's the name she went by. And very important and prosperous she was, too (so my Mother said). She lived in the best field in the whole district - a large one full of buttercups the size of saucers and dandelions rather larger than brooms. The field was all primrose-colour and gold with the buttercups and dandelions standing up in it like soldier. Every time she ate the head off one soldier, another grew up in its place, with a green military coat and a yellow busby." (p. 60, "Mary Poppins")

* "She had lived there always - she often told my Mother that she couldn't remember the time when she hand't lived in that field. Her world was bounded by green hedges and the sky and she knew nothing of what lay beyond these." (p. 60, "Mary Poppins")

The Red Cow was very respectable, she always behaved like a perfect lady and she knew What was What. To her a thing was either black or white - there was no question of it being grey or perhaps pink. People were good or they were bad - there was nothing in between. Dandelions were either sweet or sour - there were never any moderately nice ones." (p. 60, "Mary Poppins")

* "All her days were exactly the same. One Red Calf grew up and went away and another came in its place. And it was natural that the Red Cow should imagine that her life would always be the same as it always had been - indeed, she felt that she could ask for nothing better than for all her days to be alike till she came to the end of them." (p. 61, "Mary Poppins")

"But at the very moment she was thinking these thoughts, adventure, as she afterwards told Mother, was stalking her. It came upon her one night when the stars themselves looked like dandelions in the sky and the moon a great daisy among the stars." (p. 61, "Mary Poppins")

* "At last she came to the Palace where the King lived. She pulled the bell-rope with her mouth, and when the gate opened she danced through it and up the broad garden path till she came to the flight of steps that led to the King's throne.

Upon this the King was sitting, busily making a new set of Laws. His Secretary was writing them down in a little red note-book, one after another, as the King thought of them. There were Couriters and Ladies-in-Waiting everywhere, all very gorgeously dressed and all talking at once.

'How many have I made today?' asked the King, turning to the Secretary. The Secretary counted the Laws he had written down in the red note-book.

'Seventy-two, your Majesty,' he said bowing low and taking care not to trip over his quill pen, which was a very large one." (p. 63, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Very curious,' said the Courtiers, scratching their heads, too.

'What does it feel like?' asked the King.

'Funny,' said the Red Cow. 'And yet,' she paused, as if choosing her words, 'it's rather a pleasant feeling, too. As if laughter were running up and down inside me.'" (p. 66, "Mary Poppins")

* "The Red Cow, drawing in her breath, gave one huge tremendous jump and the earth fell away beneath her. She could see the figures of the King and the Courtiers growing smaller and smaller until they disappeared below. She herself shot upwards through the sky, with the stars spinning around her like great golden plates, and presently, in blinding light, she felt the cold rays of the moon upon her. She shut her eyes as she went over it, and as the dazzling gleam passed behind her and she bent her head towards the earth again, she felt the star slip down her horn. With a great rush it fell off and went rolling down the sky. And it seemed to her that as it disappeared into the darkness great chords of music came from it and echoed through the air." (pp. 69-70, "Mary Poppins")

* "The Red Cow kissed it and fell to munching the meadow. It was her first good meal for a week. And by the time her hunger was satisfied she ahd eaten up several regiments. After that she felt better. She soon began to live her life just exactly as she had lived it before.

At first she enjoyed her quiet regular habits very much, and was glad to be able to eat her breakfast without dancing and to lie down in the grass and sleep at night instead of curtseying to the moon until the morning." (p. 70, "Mary Poppins")

* "'What is today, Mary Poppins?' he enquired, pushing the bedclothes away from him.

'Tuesday, said Mary Poppins. 'Go and turn on your bath. Hurry!' she said, as he made no effort to move. He turned over and pulled the bedclothes up over his head and the curious feeling increased.

'What did I say?' said Mary Poppins in that cold, clear voice that was always a Warning." (p. 73, "Mary Poppins")

* "Through the bars of the fence he could see Miss Lark's Andrew daintily sniffing at the Next Door lawn and choosing for himself the best blades of grass. He called softly to Andrew and gave him a biscuit out of his own pocket, and while Andrew was munching it he tied Andrew's tail to the fence with a piece of string. Then he ran away with Miss Lark's angry, outraged voice screaming in his ears, and his body almost bursting with the exciting weight of that heavy thing inside him.

The door of his Father's study stood open - for Ellen had just been dusting the books. So Michael did a forbidden thing. He went in, sat down at his Father's desk, and with his Father's pen began to scribble on the blotter. Suddenly his elbow, knocking against the inkpot, upset it, and the chair and the desk and the quill pen and his own best clothes were covered with great spreading stains of blue ink. It looked dreadful, and fear of what would happen to him stirred within Michael. But, in spite of that, he didn't care - he didn't feel the least bit sorry.

'That child must be ill,' said Mrs. Banks, when she was told by Ellen - who suddenly returned and discovered him - of the latest adventure. 'Michael, you shall have some syrup of figs.'

'I'm not ill. I'm weller than you,' said Michael rudely.

'Then you're simply naughty,' said his Mother. 'And you shall be punished.'" (p. 77, "Mary Poppins")

* "'I *hate* being good,' he said aloud to himself, as he trailed after Mary Poppins and Jane and the perambulator on the afternoon walk to the Park.

'Don't dawdle,' said Mary Poppins, looking back at him.

But he went on dawdling and dragging the sides of his shoes along the pavement in order to scratch the leather." (pp. 77-78, "Mary Poppins")

* "'You,' she began, 'got out of bed the wrong side this morning.'

'I didn't,' said Michael. 'There is no wrong side to my bed.'

'Every bed has a right and a wrong side,' said Mary Poppins, primly.

'Not mine - it's next the wall.'

'That makes no difference. It's still a side,' scoffed Mary Poppins.

'Well, is the wrong side the left side or is the wrong side the right side? Because I got out on the right side, so how can it be wrong?'

'Both sides were the wrong side, this morning, Mr. Smarty!'

'But it has only one, and if I got out the right side --' he argued." (p. 78, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane and Michael gazed at each other. Was it a dream from which they would wake? Or were they seeing, of all things, a Panda! And a Panda in its own home and not behind bars in a zoo.

The dream if it was a dream, drew a long breath." (p. 84, "Mary Poppins")

* "Hills and lakes, ountains and forests went waltzing round them to unheard music. Then again the world was still, as if it had never moved." (p. 85, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Whatever kind of visit is that? Hullo and goodbye in the same breath. Next time you must stay for tea, and we'll all sit together on a rock and sing a song to the moon. Eh, Froggie?'

Froggie squeaked.

'That will be lovely,' said Mary Poppins, and Jane and Michael echoed her words. They had never yet sat on a rock and sung a song to the moon.

'Well, au revoir, one and all. By the way, Mary, my dear, were you going to take that herring with you?'

Amelia greedy eyed the fish, which, fearing the worst was about to happen, made itself as limp as it could in Mary Poppins's hand.

'No. I am planning to throw it back to the sea!' The herring gasped with relief." (p. 87, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins walked between them, wearing her new hat and looking very distinguished. Every now and then she would look into the shop window just to make sure the hat was still there and that the pink roses on it had not turned into common flowers like marigolds.

Every time she stopped to make sure, Jane and Michael would sigh, but they did not dare say anything for fear she would spend even longer looking at herself in the windows, and turning this way and that to see which attitude was the most becoming." (p. 95, "Mary Poppins")

"But at last they came to St. Paul's Cathedral, which was built a long time ago by a man with a bird's name. Wren it was, but he was no relation to Jenny. That is why so many birds live near Sir Christopher Wren's Cathendral, which also belongs to St. Paul, and that is why the Bird Woman lives there, too." (pp. 96-97, "Mary Poppins")

* "All round her flew the birds, circling and leaping and swooping and rising. Mary Poppins always called them 'sparrers,' because, she said conceitedly, all birds were alike to her. But Jane and Michael knew that they were not sparrows, but doves and pigeons. There were fussy and chatty grey doves like Grandmothers; and brown, rough-voiced pigeons like Uncles; and greeny, cackling, no-I've-no-money-today pigeons like Fathers. And the sily, anxious, soft blue doves were like Mothers. That's what Jane and Michael thought, anyway." (p. 97, "Mary Poppins")

* "They flew round and round the head of the Bird Woman as the children approached, and then, as though to tease her, they suddenly rushed away through the air and sat on the top of St. Paul's, laughing and turning their heads away and pretending they didn't know her." (p. 98, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane and Michael and Mary Poppins spread the crumbs in a circle on the ground, and presently, one by one at first, and then in twos and threes, the birds came down from St. Paul's." (p. 98, "Mary Poppins")

* "When they were quite certain that the meal was finished the birds rose with one grand, fluttering movement and flew round the Bird Woman's head, copying in their own language the words she said. One of them sat on her hat and pretended he was a decoration for the crown. And another of them mistook Mary Poppins's new hat for a rose garden and pecked off a flower." (p. 99, "Mary Poppins")

* "'At night when everybody goes to bed --' began Jane.

'And the stars come out,' added Michael.

'Yes, and even if they don't -- all the birds come down from the top of St. Paul's and run very carefully all over the ground just to see there are no crumbs left, and to tidy it up for the morning. And when they have done that --'

'You've forgotten the baths.'

'Oh, yes - they bath themselves and comb their wings with their claws. And when they have done that they fly three times round the head of the Bird Woman and then they settle." (p. 100, "Mary Poppins")

* "'And when they have done that they fly three times round the head of the Bird Woman and then they settle.'

'Do they sit on her shoulders?'

'Yes, and on her hat.'

'And on her basket with the bags in it?'

'Yes, and some on her knee. Then she smooths down the head-feathers of each one in turn and tells it to be a good bird --'

'In the bird language?'

'Yes. And when they are all sleepy and don't want to stay awake any longer, she spreads out her skirts, as a mother hen spreads out her wings, and the birds go creep, creep, creeping underneath. And as soon as the last one is under she settles down over them, making little brooding, nesting noises and they sleep there till the morning.'

Michael sighed happily. He loved the story and was never tired of hearing it.

'And it's all quite true, isn't it?' he said, just as he always did.'" (p. 101, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins gazed up and down the street as if deep in thought, and then, suddenly making up her mind, she snapped: " (p. 103, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins turned and regarded him with something like disgust." (p. 105, "Mary Poppins")

* "'That's your way,' said Mary Poppins shortly, pointing in the direction of Cherry-Tree Lane. 'If you don't get lost,' she added as an afterthought." (p. 105, "Mary Poppins")

* "Down in the kitchen Mrs. Brill was reading the paper with her spectacles perched on her nose. Robertson Ay was sitting in the garden busily doing nothing. Mrs. Banks was on the drawing-room sofa with her feet up. And the house stood very quietly around them all, dreaming its own dreams, or thinking perhaps.

Upstairs in the nursery Mary Poppins was airing the clothes by the fire, and the sunlight poured in at the window, flickering on the white walls, dancing over the cots where the babies were lying." (p. 123, "Mary Poppins")

* "'Sorry!' said the sunlight. 'But I can't help it. I've got to get across this room somehow. Orders is orders. I must move from East to West in a day and my way lies through this Nursery. Sorry! Shut your eyes and you won't notice me.'

The gold shaft of sunlight lengthened across the room. It was obviously moving as quickly as it could in order to oblige John.

'How soft, how sweet you are! I love you,' said Barbara, holding out her hands to its shining warmth.

'Good girl,' said the sunlight approvingly, and moved up over her cheeks and into her hair with a light, caressing movement. 'Do you like the feel of me?' it said, as though it loved being praised.

'Dee-licious!' said Barbara, with a happy sigh." (p. 124, "Mary Poppins")

"'Well,' he said, 'I have my business to attend to. Consultations, discussions, arguments, bargaining. And that, of course, necessitates a certain amount of - er - quiet conversation --'" (p. 125, "Mary Poppins")

* "'And what the trees say and the language of the sunlight and the stars - of course they did! *Once,*' said Mary Poppins." (p. 128, "Mary Poppins")

* "The sunlight moved on through the room, drawing its long gold shaft after it. Outside a light wind had sprung up and was whispering gently to the cherry-trees in the Lane. 

'Listen, listen, the wind's talking,' said John, tilting his head on one side. 'Do you really mean we won't be able to hear *that* when we're older, Mary Poppins?'" (p. 130, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins smiled, a secret, -I-know-better-than-you sort of smile, all to herself." (p. 133, "Mary Poppins")

* "All day long Mary Poppins had been in a hurry, and when she was in a hurry she was always cross.

Everything Jane did was bad, everything Michael did was worse. She even snapped at the Twins.

Jane and Michael kept out of her way as much as possible, for they knew that there were times when it was better not to be seen or heard by Mary Poppins.

'I wish we were invisible,' said Michael, when Mary Poppins had told him that the very sight of him was more than any self-respecting person could be expected to stand." (p. 137, "Mary Poppins")

"'We can count the money in our money-boces...

'Sixpence and four pennies - that's tempence,...'" (p. 137, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane and Michael could never remember having been put to bed so quickly as they were that night. Mary Poppins blew out the light very early, and went away as hurriedly as though all the winds of the world were blowing behind her." (p. 139, "Mary Poppins")

* "And from the loud cries that were now coming from the Green, the children could guess that he meant the Grand Chain. As they drew nearer they could hear the animals singing and shouting, and presently they saw leopards and lions, beavers, camels, bears, cranes, antelopes and many others all forming themselves into a ring round Mary Poppins." (p. 156, "Mary Poppins")

* "My wisdom tells me that this is probably so. We are all made of the same stuff, remember, we of the Jungle, you of the City. The same substance composes us - the tree overhead, the stone beneath us, the bird, the beast, the star - we are all one, all moving to the same end. Remmeber that when you no longer remember me, my child." (p. 159, "Mary Poppins")

* "'You think not?' said the Hamadryad's hissing voice. 'Look!' and he nodded his head towards the moving mass of creatures before them. Birds and animals were now swaying together, closely encircling Mary Poppins, who was rocking lightly from side to side. Backwards and forwards went the swaying crowd, keeping time together, swinging like the pendulum of a clock. Even the trees were bending and lifting gently, and the moon seemed to be rocking in the sky as a ship rocks on the sea.

'Bird and beast and stone and star - we are all one, all one ---' murmured the Hamadryad, solftly folding his hood about him as he himself swayed between the children.

'Child and serpent, star and stone -- all one.'" (pp. 159-160, "Mary Poppins")

* "'I don't mind,' said Mary Poppins with surprising mildness. Not that Jane and Michael were *really* very surprised, for they knew that the thing Mary Poppins liked doing best of all was looking in shop windows. They knew, too, that while they saw toys and books and holly-boughs and plum cakes, Mary Poppins saw nothing but herself reflected there." (p. 163, "Mary Poppins")

* "It was evident that she did not know much about spinning doors, for she went round and round inside it, pushing ti so that it should spin faster and laughing as it caught her and sent her whirling round and round. Then suddenly, with a quick little movement she freed herself, sprang away from it and landed inside the shop." (p. 167, "Mary Poppins")

* "Mary Poppins gave a quick glance into the window beside her. She saw herself shining back at her, very smart, very interesting, her hat on straight, her coat nicely pressed and her new gloves just completing the whole effect." (p. 174, "Mary Poppins")

* "Jane and Michael knew this at once, because they heard Mr. Banks singing in his bath, and there was only one day in the year when he did that." (p. 179, "mary Poppins")

* "She nodded. 'The wind's in the West,' she said slowly. Neither of them said any more, but there was a thought in each of their minds that htey wished was not there.

They forgot it soon, however, for everything seemed to be as it always was, and the Spring sunlight lit up the house so beautifully that nobody remembered it needed a coat of paint and new wall-papers. On the contrary, they all found themselves thinking that it was the best house in Cherry-Tree Lane." (pp. 180-181, "Mary Poppins")

* "Every one of these old people was over ninety. They were as shriveled as prunes, and as bony as skeletons, and throughout the day, until Charlie made his appearance, they lay huddled in their one bed, two at either end, with nightcaps on to keep their heads warm, dozing the time away with nothing to do. But as soon as they heard the door opening, and heard Charlie's voice saying, 'Good evening, Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, and Grandpa George and Grandma Georina,' then all four of them would suddenly sit up, and their wrinkled faces would light up with smiles of pleasure - and the talking would begin. For they loved this little boy. He was the only bright thing in their lives." (p. 8, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'You see, Charlie,' he said, 'not so very long ago there used to be thousands of people working in Mr. Willy Wonka's factory. Then one day, all of a sudden, Mr. Wonka had to ask every single one of them to leave, to go home, never to come back.'" (p. 15, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)

* "'But the factory is working!' the people shouted. 'Listen! You can hear the machines! They're all whirring again! And you can smell the smell of melting choclate in the air!'" (p. 17, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'The place is full of workers!' the people shouted. "But nobody's gone in! The gates are locked! It's crazy! Nobody ever comes out, either!'" (p. 17, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)

* "Mr. Wonka invents some new and wonderful candy, neither Mr. Fickelgruber nor Mr. Prodnose nor Mr. Slugworth nor anybody else is able to copy it. No spies can go into the factory to find out how it is made." (p. 18, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'The man's dotty!' muttered Grandma Josephine.

'He's briliant', cried Grandpa Joe. 'He's a magician! Just imagine what will happen now! The whole world will be searching for those Golden Tickets! Everyone will be buying Wonka's candy bars in the hope of finding one! He'll sell more than ever before! Oh, how exciting it would be to find one!'

'And all the chocolate and candies that you could eat for the rest of your life - free!' said Grandpa George. 'Just imagine that!'" (p. 20, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Then suddenly, as though he couldn't bear the suspense any longer, Charlie tore the wrapper right down the middle...and on to his lap, there fell....a light-brown creamy-colored chocolate candy bar." (pp. 28-29, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "And now the whole country, indeed, the whole world seemed suddenly to be caught up in a mad candy-buying spree, everybody searching frantically for those precious remaining tickets. Fully grown women were seen going into sweetshops and buying ten Wonka candy bars at a time, then tearing off the wrappers on the spot and peering eagerly underneath for a glint of golden paper. Children were taking hammers and smashing their piggy banks and running out to the shops with handfuls of money. In one city, a famous gangster robbed a bank of five thousand dollars and spent the whole lot on candy bars that same afternoon. And when the police entered his house to arrest him, they found him sitting on the floor amidst mountains of candy, ripping off the wrappers with the blade of a long dagger. In far-off Russia, a woman called Charlotte Russe claimed to have found the second ticket, but it turned out to be a clever fake. In England, the famous scientist, Professor Foulbody, invented a machine which would tell you at once, without opening the wrapper of a candy bar, whether or not there was a Golden Ticket hidden underneath it." (p 23, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Where's my Golden Ticket! I want my Golden Ticket!' And she would lie for hours on the floor, kicking and yelling in the most disturbing way. Well sir, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that, so I vowed I would keep up the search until I'd got her what she wanted. Then suddenly...on the evening of the fourth day, one of my women workers yelled, 'I've got it! A Golden Ticket!' And I said, 'Give it to me, quick!' and she did, and I rushed it home and gave it to my darling Veruca, and now she's all smiles, and we have a happy home once again.'" (p. 25, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Charlie smiled nervously and sat down on the edge of the bed. He was holding his present, his only present, very carefully in his two hands. Wonka's whipple-scrumptious fudgemallow delight, it said on the wrapper." (p. 26, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "The room became silent. Everybody was waiting now for Charlie to start opening his present. Charlie looked down at the candy bar. He ran his fingers slowly back and forth along the length of it, stroking it lovingly, and the shiny paper wrapper made little sharp crackly noises in the quiet room." (p. 27, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Charlie looked up. Four kind old faces were watching him intently from the bed. He smiled at them, a small sad smile, and then he shrugged his shoulders and picked up the candy bar and held it out to his mother, and said, 'Here Mother, have a bit. We'll share it. I want everybody to taste it.'" (p. 29, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)

* "'The third ticket,' read Mr. Bucket, holding the newspaper up close to his face because his eyes were bad and he couldn't afford glasses, 'the third Ticket was found by a Miss Violet Beauregarde. There was great excitement in the Beauregarde household when our reporter arrived to interview the lucky young lady - cameras were clicking and flashbulbs were flashing and people were pushing and jostling and trying to get a bit closer to the famous girl. And the famous girl was standing on a chair in the living-room waving the Golden Ticket madly at arm's length as though she were flagging a taxi. She was talking very fast and very loudly to everyone, but it was not easy to hear all that she said because she was chewing so ferociously upon a piece of gum at the same time." (pp. 30-31, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Charlie burst through the front door, shouting, 'Mother! Mother! Mother!' Mrs. Bucket was in the old grandparents' room, serving them their evening soup. 'Mother!' yelled Charlie, rushing in on them like a hurricane. 'Look! I've got it! Look, Mother, look! The last Golden Ticket! It's mine! I found some money in the street and I bought two candy bars and the second one had the Golden Ticket and there were crowds of people all around me wanting to see it and the shopkeeper rescued me and I ran all the way home and here I am! It's The Fifth Golden Ticket, Mother, and I've found it!'" (pp. 46-47, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Charlie picked it up and tore off the wrapper...and suddenly...from underneath the wrapper...there came a brilliant flash of gold.

Charlie's heart stood still.

'It's a Golden Ticket!' screamed the shopkeeper, leaping about a foot in the air. 'You've got a Golden Ticket! You've found the last Golden Ticket! Hey, what do you know! Come and look at this, everybody! The kid's found Wonka's last Golden Ticket! There it is! It's right there in his hands!" (p. 44, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka! I shake you warmly by the hand! Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you! For now, I do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for one whole day - you and all others who are lucky enough to find my Golden Tickets. I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself, showing you everything that there is to see, and afterwards, when it is time to leave, you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks. These trucks, I can promise you, will be loaded with enough delicious eatables to last you and your entire household for many years. If, at any time thereafter, you should run out of supplies, you have only to come back to the factory and show this Golden Ticket, and I shall be happy to refill your cupboard with whatever you want. In this way, you will be able to keep yourself supplied with tasty morsels for the rest of your life." (p. 50, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Yippeeeeee!' shouted Grandpa Joe, seizing Charlie by the hands and dancing round the room." (p. 52, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")
* "'Hallelujah!' yelled Grandpa Joe. 'Praise the Lord!'" (p. 53, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "At that point, there came a loud knock on the front door. Mr. Bucket went to open it, and the next moment, swarms of newspaperment and photographers were pouring into the house. They had tracked down the finder of the fifth Golden Ticket, and now they all wanted to get the full story for the front pages of morning papers. For several hours, there was complete pandemomium in the little house, and it must have been nearly midnight before Mr. Bucket was able to get rid of them so that Charlie could go to bed." (p. 53, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "The sun was shining brightly on the morning of the big day, but the ground was still white with snow and the air was very cold." (p. 53, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Outside the gates of Wonka's factory, enormous crowds of people had gathered to watch the five lucky ticket holders going in. The excitement was tremendous. It was just before ten o'clock. The crowds were pushing and shouting, and policemen with arms linked were trying to hold them back from the gates." (p. 53, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Mr. Wonka was standing all alone just inside the open gates of the factory.

And what an extraordinary little man he was!

He had a black top hat on his head.

He wore a tail coat made of a beautiful plum-colored velvet.

His trousers were bottle green.

His gloves were pearly gray.

And in one hand he carried a fine gold-topped walking cane.

Covering his chin, there was a small neat pointed black beard - a goatee. And his eyes - his eyes were most marvelously bright. They seemed to be sparkling and twinkling at you all the time. The whole face, in fact, was alight with fun and alughter." (p. 57, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

"'An important room, this!' cried Mr. Wonka, taking a bunch of keys from his pocket and slipping one into the keyhole of the door. 'This is the nerve center of the whole factory, the heart of the whole business! And so beautiful! I insist upon my rooms being beautiful! I can't abide ugliness in factories! In we go, then! But do be careful, my dear children! Don't lose your heads! Don't get overexcited! Keep very calm!" (p. 63, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "They were looking down upon a lovely valley. There were green meadows on either side of the valley, and along the bottom of it there flowed a great brown river." (p. 63, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'There!' cried Mr. Wonka, dancing up and down and pointing his gold-topped cane at the great brown river. 'It's all chocolate! Every drop of that river is hot melted chocolate of the finest quality. The very finest quality. There's enough chocolate in there to fill every bathtup in the entire country! And all the swimming pools as well! Isn't it terrific? And just look at my pipes! They suck up the chocolate and carry it away to all the other rooms in the factory where it is needed! Thousands of gallons an hour, my dear children! Thousands and thousands of gallons!'" (p. 64, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'The waterfall is most important!' Mr. Wonka went on. 'It mixes the chocolate! It churns it up! It pounds it and beats it. It makes it light and frothy! No other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall! But it's the only way to do it properly! The only way! And do you like my trees?,' he cried, pointing with his stick. 'And my lovely bushes?' Don't you think they look pretty? I told you I hated ugliness! And of course they are all eatable! All made of something different and delicious! And do you like my meadows? Do you like my grass and my buttercups?" (p. 66, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "When I went out there, I found the little Oompa-Loompas living in tree-houses. They *had* to live in tree-houses to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers and the snozzwangers. And they were practically starving to death. They were living on green caterpillars, and the caterpillars tasted revolting and the Oompa-Loompas spent every moment of their days climbing through the treetops looking for other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better - red beetles, for instance, and eucalyptus leaves, and the bark of the bong-bong tree, all of them beastly, but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars." (p. 69, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "Chocolate tastes even better than cacao beans because it's got milk and sugar added." (p. 71, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "So I shipped them all over here, every man, woman, and child in the Oompa-Loompa tribe. It was easy. I smuggled them over in large packing cases with holes in them, and they all got here safely. They are wonderful workers. They all speak English now. They love dancing and music. They are always making up songs. I expect you will hear a good deal of singing today from time to time. I must warn you, though, that they are rather mischievous. They like jokes. They still wear the same kind of clothes they wore in the jungle. They insist upon that. The men, as you can see for yourselves across the river, wear only deerskins. The women wear leaves, and the children wear nothing at all. The women use fresh leaves every day...'" (p. 71, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "When Mr. Wonka turned round and saw what Augustus Gloop was doing, he cried out, 'Oh, no! Please, Augustus, please! I beg of you not to do that. My chocolate must be untouched by human hands!'

'Augustus!' called out Mrs. Gloop. 'Didn't you hear what the man said? Come away from that river at once!'

'This stuff is tee-riffic!' said Augustus, taking not the slightest notice of his mother or Mr. Wonka. 'Oh boy, I need a bucket to drink it properly!'" (p. 72, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Be careful, Augustus!' shouted Mr. Gloop. 'You're leaning too far out!'

Mr. Gloop was absolutely right. For suddenly there was a shriek, and then a splash, and into the river went Augustus Gloop, and in one second he had disappeared under the brown surface.

'Save him!' screamed Mrs. Gloop, going white in the face, and waving her umbrella about. 'He'll drown! He can't swim a yard! Save him! Save him!

'Good heavens, woman,' said Mr. Gloop, 'I'm not diving in there! I've got my best suit on!'

Augustus Gloop's face came up again to the surface, painted brown with chocolate. 'Help! Help! Help!' he yelled. 'Fish me out!'" (p. 73, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Good heavens, woman,' said Mr. Gloop, 'I'm not diving in there! I've got my best suit on!'

Augustus Gloop's face came up again to the surface, painted brown with chocolate. 'Help! Help! Help!' he yelled. 'Fish me out!'

'Don't just *stand* there!' Mrs. Gloop screamed at Mr. Gloop. '*Do* something!'

'I *am* doing something! said Mr. Gloop, who was now taking off his jacket and getting ready to dive into the chocolate. But while he was doing this, the wretched boy was being sucked closer and closer toward the mouth of one of the great pipes that was dangling down into the river. Then all at once, the powerful suction took hold of him completely, and he was pulled under the surface and then into the mouth of the pipe.

The crowd on the riverbank waited breathlessly to see where he would come out." (pp. 73-74, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "The watchers below could see the choclate swishing around the boy in the pipe, and they could see it building up behind him in a solid mass, pushing against the blockage. The pressure was terrific. Something had to give. Something did give, and that something was Augustus. *Whoof!* Up he shot again like a bullet in the barrel of a gun." (p. 74, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'You think it's a joke, do you? You think that sucking my boy up into your Fudge Room like that is just one great big colossal joke?'

'He'll be perfectly safe,' said Mr. Wonka, giggling slightly.

'He'll be chocolate fudge!' shrieked Mr. Gloop.

'Never!' cried Mr. Wonka.

'Of course he will!' shriekd Mrs. Gloop." (p. 76, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* *"'Augustus Gloop!' chanted the Oompa-Loompas.
*'Augustus Gloop!' Augustus Gloop!
The great big greedy nincompoop!
How long could we allow this beast
To gorge and guzzle, feed and feast
On everything he wanted to?
Great Scott! It simply wouldn't do!
However long this pig might live,
We're positive he'd never give
Even the smallest bit of fun
Or happienss to anyone.
So what we do in cases such
As this, we use the gentle touch,
And carefully we take the brat
And turn him into something that
Will give great pleasure to us all -
A doll, for instance, or a ball,
Or marbles or a rocking horse.
But this revolting boy, of course,
Was so unutterably vile,
So greedy, foul, and infantile,
He left a most disgusting taste
Inside our mouths, and so in haste,
We close a thing that, come what may,
Would take the nasty taste away.
'Come on!' we cried, 'The time is ripe
To send him shotting up the pipe!
He has to go! It has to be!
And very soon, he's going to see
Inside the room to which he's gone
Some funny things are going on.
But don't, dear children, be alarmed;
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed,
Although, of course, we must admit
He will be altered quite a bit.
He'll be quite changed from what he's been,
When he goes through the fudge machine:
Slowly, the wheels go round and round,
The cogs begin to grind and pound;
A hundred knives to slice, slice, slice;
We add some sugar, cream, and spice;
We boil him for a minute more,
Until we're absolutely sure
That all the greed and all the gall
Is boiled away for once and all.
Then out he comes! And now! By grace!
A miracle has taken place!
This boy, who only just before
Was loathed by men from shore to shore,
This greedy brute, this louse's ear,
Is loved by people everywhere!
For who could hate or bear a grudge
Against a luscious bit of fudge'" (pp. 79-80, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* *"There's no earthly way of knowing                                                                                                                            Which direction they are going!

* For the rowers keep on rowing,
* And they're certainly not showing
* Any signs that they are slowing...' (pp. 84-85, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction they are going!
There's no knowing where they're rowing,
Or which way the river's flowing!
Not a speck of light is showing,
So the danger must be growing,
For the rowers keep on rowing,
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing..." (pp. 84-85, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "There was a pause. Then suddenly, Violet Beauregarde, the goofy gum-chewing girl, let out a yell of excitement/ 'By gum, it's gum!' she shrieked. 'It's a stick of chewing gum!' "Right you are!' cried Mr. Wonka, slapping Violet hard on the back. 'It's a stick of gum! It's a stick of the most *amazing* and *fabulous* and *sensational* gum in the world!'" (pp. 93-94, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

"'The gum,' Mr. Wonka went on, 'is my latest, my greatest, my most fascinating invention! It's a chewing-gum meal! It's..it's...it's...that tiny little strip of gum lying there is a whole three-course dinner all by itself!'" (p. 94, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Stop!' said Mr. Wonka. 'The gum isn't ready yet! It's not right!'

'Of course it's right!' said Violet. 'It's working beautifully! Oh my, what lovely soup this is!'

'Spit it out!' said Mr. Wonka.

'It's changing!' shouted Violet, chewing and grinning both at the same time. 'The second course is coming up! It's roast beef! It's tender and juicy! Oh boy, what a flavor! The baked potato is marvelous, too! It's got a crispy skin and it's all filled with butter inside!' 

'But how in-teresting, Violet,' siad Mrs. Beauregarde. 'You *are* a clever girl.'

'Keep chewing, kiddo!' said Mr. Beauregarde. 'Keep right on chewing, baby! This is a great day for the Beauregardes! Our little girl is the first person in the world to have a chewing-gum meal!

Everybody was watching Violet Beauregarde as she stood there chewing this extraordinary gum. Little Charlie Bucket was staring at her absolutely spellbound, watching her huge rubbery lips as they pressed and unpressed with the chewing, and Grandpa Joe stood beside him gaping at the girl. Mr. Wonka was wringing his hands and saying, 'No, no, no, no, no! It isn't ready for eating! It isn't right! You mustn't do it!'

'Blueberry pie and cream!' shouted Violet. 'Here it comes! Oh my, it's perfect! It's beautiful! It's...it's exactly as though I'm swallowing it! It's as though I'm chewing and swallowing great big spoonfuls of the most marvelous blueberry pie in the world!'" (p. 96, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'Oh, be quiet, mother, and let me finish!' said Violet.

'It's turning blue!' screamed Mrs. Beauregarde. 'Your nose is turning blue as a blueberry!'

'Your mother is right!' shouted Mr. Beauregarde. 'Your whole nose has gone purple!'

'What do you mean?' said Violet, still chewing away.

'Your cheeks!' screamed Mrs. Beauregarde. 'They're turning blue as well! So is your chin! Your whole face is turning blue!'

'Split that gum out at once!' ordered Mr. Beauregarde.

'Mercy! Save us!' yelled Mrs. Beauregarde. 'The girl's going blue and purple all over! Even her hair is changing color! Violet, you're turning violet, Violet! What is happening to you!'

'I told you I hadn't got it quite right,' sighed Mr. Wonka, shaking his head sadly.

'I'll say you haven't!' cried Mrs. Beauregarde. 'Just look at the girl now!'

Everybody was staring at Violet. And what a terrible peculiar sight she was! Her face and hands and legs and neck, in fact the skin all over her body, as well as her great big mop of curly hair, had turned a brilliant, purplish-blue, the color of blueberry juice!

'It always goes wrong whene we come to the dessert,' sighed Mr. Wonka. 'It's the blueberry pie that does it. But I'll get ti right one day you wait and see.'" (p. 97, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "'I'm not surprised! said Mr. Beauregarde.

'Great heavens, girl!' screeched Mrs. Beauregarde. 'You're blowing up like a balloon!'

'Like a blueberry,' said Mr. Wonka.

'Call a doctor!' shouted Mr. Beauregarde.

'Prick her with a pin!' said one of the other fathers.

'Save her!' cried Mrs. Beauregarde, wringing her hands. 

But there was no saving her now. Her body was swelling up and changing shape at such a rate that within a minute it had turned into nothing less than an enormous round blue ball - a gigantic blueberry, in fact - and all that remained of Violet Beauregarde herself was a tiny pair of legs and a tiny pair of arms sticking out of the great round fruit and a little head on top." (p. 98, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

* "The voices, one hundred of them singing together, came loud and clear into the room:

*"Dear friends, we surely all agree
There's almost nothing worse to see
Than some repulsive little bum
Who's always chewing chewing gum.
(It's very near as bad as those
Who sit around and pick the nose).
So please believe us when we say
That chewing gum will never pay.
This sticky habit's bound to send
The chewer to a sticky end.
Did any of you ever know
A person called Miss Bigelow?
This dreadful woman saw no wrong
In chewing, chewing all day long.
She chewed while bathing in the tub.
She chewed while dancing at her club.
She chewed in church and on the bus.
It really was quite ludicrous!
And when she couldn't find her gum,
She'd chew up the linoleum,
Or anything that happened near -
A pair of botos, the postmans' ear,
Or other people's underclothes,
And once she chewed her boy friend's nose.
She went on chewing till, at last,
Her chewing muscles grew so vast
That from her face her giant chin
Stuck out just like a violin.
For years and years she chewed away.
Consuming fifty packs a day,
Until one summer's eve, alas,
A horrid business came to past.
Miss Bigelow went late to bed,
For half an hour she lay and read,
Chewing and chewing all the while
Like some great clockwork crocodile.
At last, she put her gum away.
Upon a special little tray.
And settled back and went to sleep -
(She managed this by coutning sheep).
But now, how strange! Although she slept,
Those massive jaws of hers still kept
On chewing, chewing through the night,
Even with nothing there to bite,
They were, you see, in such a groove
They positive had to move.
And very grim it was to hear
In pitch darkness, loud and clear,
This sleeping woman's great big tap
Opening and shutting, snap-snap-snap!
Faster and faster, chop-chop-chop.
The noise went on, it wouldn't stop.
Until at last her jaws decide
To pause and open extra wide,
And with the most tremendous chew
They bit the lady's tongue in two.'
Thereafter, just from chewing gum,
Miss Bigelow was always dumb,
And spent her life shut up in some
Disgusting sanatorium.
And that is why we'll try so hard
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde
From suffereing an equal fate.
She's still quite young. It's not too late
Provided she survives the cure.
We hope she does. We can't be sure."* (pp. 99-101, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)

*"'Veruca Salt!' sang the Oompa-Loompas.
'Veruca Salt, the little brute,
Has just gone down the garbage chute,
(And as we very rightly thought
That in a case like this we ought
To see the thing completely through,
We've polished off her parents, too.)
Down goes Veruca! Down the drain!
And here, perhaps, we should explain
That she will meet, as she descends.
A rather different set of friends
To those that she has left behind -
These won't be nearly so refined.
A fish bead, for example, cut
This morning from a halibut.
Hello! Good morning! How d'you do?
How nice to meet you! How are you?'
And then a little further down
A mass of others gather round:'
A bacon rind, some rancid lard,
A loaf of bread gone stale and hard,
A steak that nobody could chew,
An oyster from an oyster stew
Some liverwurst so old and gray
One smelled it from a mile away,
A rotten nut, a reeky pear,
A thing the cat left on the stair,
And lots of other things as well,
Each with a rather horrid smell,
These are Veruca's new found friends
That she will meet as sche descends,
And this is the price she has to pay
For going so very far astray.
But now, my dears, we think you might
Be wondering -s it really right
That every single bit of blame
And all the scolding and the shame
Should fall upon Veruca Salt?
Is she the only one at fault?
For though she's soiled, and dreadfully so,
A girl can't spoil herself, you know
Who spoiled her, then? Ah, who indeed?
Who pandered to her every need?
Who turned her into such a brat?
Who are the culprits? Who did that?
Alas! You needn't look so far,
TO find out who these sinners are.
They are (and this is very sad)
Her loving parents, MUM and DAD
And that is why we're glad they fell
Into the garbage chute as well.*'" (pp. 117-118, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

*"'The most important thing we've learned,
So far as children are concerned,
Is never, NEVER, NEVER let 
Them near your television set -
Or better still, jsut don't install
The idiotic thing at all.
In almost every house we've been,
We've watched them gaping at the screen.
They loll and slop and lounge about.
And stare until their eyes pop out.
(Last week in someone's place we saw
A dozen eyeballs on the floor.
They sit and stare and stare and sit
Until they're hypnotised by it
Until they're absolutely drunk
With all that shocking ghastly junk,
Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,
They don't climb out the window sill,
They never fight or kick or punch,
They leave you free to cook the lunch
And wash the dishes in the sink -
But did you ever stop to think,
To wonder just exactly what
This does to your beloved tot?
It rots the senses in the head!
It kills imagination dead!
It clogs and clutters up the mind!
It makes a child so dull and blind
He can no longer understand
a fantasy, a fairyland!
His brain become as soft as cheese!
His pwoers of thinking rust and freeze!
He cannot think - he only sees!
'All right!' you cry. 'All right!' you'' say,
But if we take the set away,
What shall we do to entertain
Our darling children? Please explain!
We'll answer this by asking you,
What used the darling ones to do?
How used they keep themselves contented
Before this monster was invented?'
Have you forgotten? Don't you know?
We'll say it very loud and slow:
They...used...to...read! They'd read and read, and read, and read...
...reading books
The nursery shelves held books galore!
Books cluttered up the nrusery floor!
And in the bedroom, by the bed,
More books were waiting to be read!
Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales
Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales,
And treasure isles, and distant shores,
Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,
And pirates wearing purple pants,
And sailing ships and elephants,
And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,
Stirring away at something hot.
(It smells so good, what can it be!
Good gracious, it's Penelope.)
The younger ones had Beatrix Potter
With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,
And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland
And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-
Just How The Camel Got His Hump,
And How The Monkey Lost His Pump,
And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,
There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole -
Oh, books, what books they used to know,
Those children living long ago!
So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,
Go throw your TV set away,
And in its place you can install
A lovely bookshelf on the wall.
Then fill the shelves with lots of books,
Ignoring all the dirty looks, 
The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,
And children hitting you with sticks - 
Fear not, because we promise you
That, in about a week or two
Of having nothing else to do,
They'll now begin to feel the need
Of having something good to read.
And once they start - oh boy, oh boy!
You watch the slowly growing joy
THat fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen
They'll wonder what they'd ever seen
In that ridiculous machine,
That nauseating, foul, unclean,
Repulsive television screen!
And later, each and every kid
Will love you more for what you did.
P.S. Regarding Mike Teavee,
We very much regret that we 
Shall simply have to wait and see
If we can get him back his height
But if we can't - it serves him right.'* " (pp. 139-141, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory")

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "His face lighted with admiration." (p. 3, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "In the wintertime it is, when we sail to the West Indies. But I was born in Saybrook, and in the spring I get to hankering for my house and garden. Besides, I'd never let on to my husband, but the summer trips are tedious, just back and forth up and down the river. I stay at home and tend my vegetables and my spinning like a proper housewife. Then, come November, when he sails for Barbados again, I'm ready enough to go with him. 'Tis a good life, and one of the best things about it is coming home in the springtime.'" (p. 4, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "With a bound she was over the side and had set foot on America. She stood taking deep breaths of the salt, fish-tainted air, and looked about for someone to share her excitement. She was quite forgotten. A throng of men and boys on the wharf had noisily closed in on the three Eatons, and she could hear a busy catching up of the past months' news." (p. 5, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "To make matters worse, America was behaving strangely underfoot. As she stepped forward, the wharf tilted upward, and she felt curiously lightheaded." (p. 6, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "The shock of cold, totally unexpected, almost knocked her senseless. As her head came to the surface she could not catch her breath at all. But after a dazed second she sighted the bobbing piece of wood and instinctively struck out after it in vigorous strokes that set her blood moving again. She had the doll in her hand before her numbed mind realized that there had been a second splash, and as she turned back she saw that Nathaniel was in the water beside her, thrashing with a clumsy paddling motion. She could not help laughing as she passed him, and with a feeling of triumph she beat him to the boat." (p. 8, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "Her high spirits plunged." (p. 10, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "A smile filled his eyes with such warmth and sympathy that a lump rose in Kit's throat, and she glanced away. Then she saw that the child, silently clutching her sodden doll, was staring at her with a gaze of pure worship." (p. 10, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "With the narrowing of the river the fresh sea breeze dropped behind, and by sunset it died away altogether. The sails sagged limp and soundless, and the Dolphin rolled sickeningly in midstream. On one or two evenings a temporary breeze raised their hopes and sent the ship ahead a few miles, only to die away again. In the morning Kit could scarcely tell that they had moved." (p. 15, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "Two sailors in a small boat went some distance ahead bearing a long rope fastened to a small anchor. Rowing as far as the rope would stretch, they dropped the anchor. On the deck of the ship the crew lined up, ten hearty men bared to the waist, each grasping the rope, and began a rhythmical march from one end of the ship to the other. As one man reached the end, he dropped the rope, and raced back to grasp it again at the end of the line. Painfully, almost imperceptibly, the Dolphin inched forward through the water. In an hour's time they had reached the anchor and the rowboat went ahead a second time. Over and over, hour after hour, the men moved, hauling the ship by the sheer force of straining muscle and gasping breath." (p. 21, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "Along with her pretty shoes Kit's spirits sank lower at each step. She had clutched at a hope that the dark fringe of dripping trees might somehow be concealing the town she had anticipated." (p. 29, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "In her eagerness to make a good impression Kit had selected this dress with care, but here in this plain room it seemed overelegant. The three other women were all wearing some nondescript sort of coarse gray stuff." (p. 33, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "After the candles were lit, Rachel and the two girls picked up skeins of yarn and began to knit as Matthew drew the great Bible toward him across the table. Matthew's voice was harsh and monotonous. Kit could not keep her mind on the words. Every muscle in her body ached with weariness. As the reading went on her head grew heavier, and twice she jerked herself painfully back from the bring of sleep. The others, intent on their knitting, did not notice. Only when her uncle closed the Book and bent his head for the long evening prayer, did the clicking needles cease." (p. 49, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "There was no Church of England in Wethersfield, her uncle had informed her, and furthermore, since she was now a member of his household she would forget her popish ideas and attend Meeting like a God-fearing woman. This time, however, he was baffled; he knew as well as she that there were no garments to spare in that house." (p. 51, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "The sun slanted directly downward through the clinks in the roof when the sermon ended. It must have been a good two hours, and would, Kit suspected have been much longer had not the minister's voice grown increasingly hoarse till it threatened-to fail altogether. Kit rose thankfully for the final prayer, and stood respectfully with the rest of the congregation till the minister had passed down the aisle the door." (pp. 54-55, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "The roadway was bordered and daisies and buttercups, pale and thin, of course, compared to the brilliant masses of color in Barbados, but pretty all the same." (pp. 75-76, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "What patience Mercy, ahd@ If only patience were contagious like mumps. Kit sighed and urned back to the primer. Of all the dreary monotous sermons! Grandfather would never have allowed her to learn from such a book. She wished she could remember her grandfather had taught her the syllables and word. She suspected that he had made up his own lessons, and now, as her small pupiles spelled out the gloomy text, she could not resist following his example. She seized a quill pen and printed two lines on a scrap of the curly birch bark which the children collected to use in place of costly paper." (p. 83, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "Now she had only the BIble to read to them, but there was far more between those black covers than the verses Uncle Matthew favored. Kit chose the stories she herself enjoyed most, and her reading had a zest and liveliness that enthralled the children. Even Mercy was surprised, and frequently a little distrubed at the drama that Kit seemed to discover in these long-familiar narratives." (p. 86, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

* "Today she chose the parable of the Good Samaritan. 'Now a certain man,' she began, 'went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves - Suddenly she had an inspiration. Years ago, her grandfather had taken her to see a masque in Bridgetown, in which a troupe of players from England had acted out the ancient Christmas story." (p. 86, The Witch of Blackbird Pond)

## [Frightful's Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Frightfuls-Mountain-Jean-Craighead-George/dp/0141312351/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=frightful%27s+mountain&qid=1621260655&s=books&sr=1-1) by Jean Craighead George (c. 1999) ##
### Author ###
* "In 1986, I met Jean Craighead George at a friend's home in the upstate New York town were we all live. I grew up admiring the Craigheads, a family of naturalists, whose adventures I followed in *National Geographic* magazine, where they always seemed to be attaching transmitters to grizzly bears, banding bald eagles, or paddling canoes and fiberglass kayaks on first descents down the best western white waters. Always, there were flocks of children participating in every adventure and experiment. I thought the Craigheads might be the only family in America that was having more fun than the Kennedys. Obsessed with falcons as I was from birth, I read *My Side of the Mountain* in 1964. When I met Jean Craighead George that day in New York, she reminded me about the letter that I had written her"

* "trap fifty hawks: peregrines, Cooper's hawks, sharp-shins, red-tails, goshawks, merlins, and golden eagles"

* "lifelong devotion to raptors" and "natural history"

* "The knowledge and experience I acquired from falconers have marked my life and made me a far more effective advocate on nature's behalf. I have to assume that thousands of other children outside my immediate circle were also inspired to varying degrees of ecological stewardship by their exposure to Sam Gribley's adventures in *My Side of the Mountain*. It's my hope that this wonderful sequel, *Frightful's Mountain*, will inspire thousands of new kids."

### Who? ###
Frightful, the peregrine falcon is the main character and enjoys quiet like daytime birds with whistling, wind music, and images of strange woods, unknown flowers, foreign sound, soft song of wind humming through the hemlock needles of home. Sam Gribley has a relationship with the falcon.

### Where? ###
* It takes place in nature with the sky and the winds, the mountain, and the "forest clearing edged with bushes that were song sparrows and cardinals lived".

### What? ###
* Sam lifted the falcon from the nest on the cliff, and she jabbed him. Sam names her "Frightful", and she says, that she is "a raving beauty" and "a gigantic hemlock tree on the mountain". He nurtured her like a peregrine falcon mother would, and he made a perch for her. He hunted with her, and made memories with her. Frightful loved the sky, wind, and feathers. Sam names her "Frightful", and says, that she is "a raving beauty" and a "gigantic hemlock tree on the mountain". He shares the relationship between nature, engineering, trucks, and industry. He hears the bells tinkling along with the Falcons.

He glanced at Mole. The dog's eyes were closed. 'We're on page one hundred thirty-one in Jack Fruchtman Jr.'s book called *Thomas Paine*,' he said" (p. 210 Frightful's Mountain)

 * "She saw trees, boulders, the millpond, and high above them a bright glimpse of blue sky. The sky captivated her. She sensed she should be there. She flapped her wings. Nothing happened. The air was still. No wind gave her lift. She closed her wings to her body and flicked ehr tial in frustration. She needed to be in that sky." (p. 211, Frightful's Mountain)

* "A flock fo starling swarmed past him, fanning out and coming back together. He found them interesting - they flew, they moved - they wre birds. They swooped into the bushes and vanished." (p. 217, Frightful's Mountain)

Here thousands of migrating waterfowl came down to rest on the water. They were easy to catch, and when they moved on, he went with them. His early visual memory of life with Perry was forgotten. He followed the birds. He was not, after all, imprinted." (p. 221, Frightful's Mountain)

* Bando

### Where? ###
* Mountaintop, home
* the great tree trunksf
* Greeland, Canada, the Catskills

### What? ###
* "I can barely see the huge hemlock tree in which I live. I like the haze. It has erased all but the great tree trunks, making my mountaintop home as simple as it was whne i first cam here more than two years ago."
* "saplings held together with rope made from the inner bark of the basswood tree"
* "A wind rises as the sun warms the earth. The haze moves off, and I see my. pond, my millhouse, and the root cellar."
* "The first year I lived here I had only a tree, a bed, and a fireplace. But one idea led to another, and the next thing I knew, I had built myself a habitat. Things just kept evolving. Take this lounging chair, for instance. One day I replaced the old stump I sat on with a three-legged stool,a nd then I replaced the three-legged stool with this comfortable chair."

* the Falcon's flying - "When she flies, she is still a crossbow in the sky, and she still 'waits on' above my head until I kick up a pheasant or a rabbit.'"
* "she is flying high above"
"'Creee, creee, creee, car-reet'"

* Relationship between Sam and the Falcon
* "I call her name in her own language; I whistle three notes - low, high, low. She responds by lifting the feathers on her body, then shaking them. This is called rousing, whic is feather talk meaning, 'I like you' I can't speak in feathers so I answer by imitating her love notes. I do this by pulling air through my two front teeth to make a soft, cozy sound."

* "He really is a falconer. Hack is an old falconry temr. Trainers put young unleashed birds who are just learning to fly and hunt on a hack board, a sort of artificial nest. They leave them there with food, just as the parents do at the nest. The youngsters, falconers say, are 'at hack' - free to fly and hunt. If they miss their prey they come back to the board to eat. After a juvenile makes its first kill, the falconers leash and train it. I guess Frightful's young would be put at hack, but nto jessed and leashed when they learned to hunt. Instead, they would fly on and live out their lives in the wild. I ask the officer if that is so." (p. 9, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'Come on,' I said, jumping to my feet. 'Let's make a water mill!' I started off to get the lumber once meant for Dad's house, but Alice was not budging. She stood still with her hands on her hips." (p. 19, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'First of all I want a house.'
'A house?' I said.
This young lady, I realized, was not planning to cry and go home tomorrow.
'Yes,' she answered, 'a house. I need a place to live. There's not enough room in your tree for me.'
'I can sleep outside.'" (p. 19, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "It had gorwn up in the open, probably when that side of the mountain was an Indian field, for its limbs grow horizontally to the groundm not up as they do when a white oak grows in a forest reaching for the sun. I say Indian field, not great-grandfather's field, because the white oak, like my hemlock, is at least three hundred years old, maybe four. No Gribleys tilled the soil in those days."

So far this year, our venison has been only road kill from in front of Mrs. Strawberry's farm." (pp. 26-27, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "They settled in villages and planted corn and squash, bush beans and berries. We already grow groundnuts in the damp soil and squash in the poor land. But the Iroquois also hunted game. I can't do that anymore." (p. 27, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "When I am far above the river, I take off my clothes and moccasins and bathe in a deep, clear pool until I am refreshed and thinking more clearly. Climbing up the bank, I dress and sit down.

* "When she's working on a project, she gets so involved she doen't bother to come to my tree for meals. Instead she doesn't bother to come to my tree for meals. Instead she takes food from the root cellar to her tree house and works while she eats. I didn't see her for two days when she was making a mirror out of a windowpane and some mercury. When I realized she had not bought the mercury but gotten it out of a thermometer she had taken from Mr. Reily's barn, I made her buy a new one for him with some of the forty dollars I had brought with me from the city and never spent." (p. 32, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'This is the first time i've seen Zella happy on the mountain.

After an hour or so I heard the tree snap. It titled, began to fall slowly, then faster and faster until it crashed down with a splintering of limbs to lie exactly where Mrs. Strawbery had said it would. She wiped her hands, saying she should have been a lumberjack." (p. 45, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'I knew I had to burn and chip out the isnide of the tree to make a trough, like the pioneers made water pipes. It was not hard work, but it was a tedious chore I could do when I didn't have help, so Bando and I started on the waterwhell." (p. 46, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The trail to her house is bordered with stones she gathered and put there. She wanted to edge all the paths, but I objected. Bordered trails get too much use. The wildflowers can't push up, and when they don't grow, the soil erodes and is carried into the streams by the rain. The best thing to do, I told Alice, is to take different routes from place to place, or put a log across an old path and let it rest. I kick leaves onto her trail to protect it. Jessie Coon James walks up to me." (p. 55, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "She's left all her books, as far as I can see, but has taken the maps from the orienteering, or map reading, course. Also gone are her backpack and our water carrier, a square of hide folded in fourths. It's a great device, because it can also be used for a pillow or a hat - all of which means she will not be back soon." (p. 61, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Then I remember the triumphs of making a fire, catching a fish, and sleeping on a bed of pine boughs all alone in the wilderness." (p. 62, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "As I step into the yard, I glance up at my mountain. It's strong and beautiful, with the sun rising behind it. The view from here is its western side." (pp. 63-64, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "If I knew in which direction she was going, I might be able to look at a map and figure out her destination: I'd sure like to know where she's headed. She should have told me. At least I told Dad that I was going to run away to Great-grandfather Gribley's farm. He didn't believe me, but he should have. Alice hasn't even given me a hint - at least I don't recognize one if she has." (p. 65, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Then I'll go home and do the chores." (p 70, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Bando has spread several of the topographical maps on his big oak table. The maps, which you order through the United States Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, are masterpieces of mapmaking. They reflect the shape of the Earth's surface, portrayed by countour lines twenty feet apart. These brown lines are the distinctive characteristic of topographic maps. They tell you exactly where and how high you are, so you can never get lost. They also show roads, buildings, railroads, transmission lines, mines and caves, vegetation, and towns, cities, rivers, lakes, canals, marshes, and waterfalls." (p. 73, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'You say she's going east by northeast?' he says taking out a compass with a housing that has 360 degrees marked on it, as well as a clear plastic base-late with straight sides that can be used as a ruler. It also has a directional, or pointer, arrow drawn on it. The compass is for orienteering - finding your way with a map - and saves you a lot of time plotting your course. You don't have to use a protractor to figure out the degrees." (p. 73, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Animals communicating with each other, and when you learn their language, you can communicatte with them too. Scientists as well as animal lovers do this." (p. 76, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The quadrangle maps, which are literally quadrangles, 16 3/4 by 22 3/4 inches, are not like the county maps. These are land not political boundaries. Their scale is three and three-quarter inches to the mile - a lot of space to put down the details. On the Delhi quadrangle map is Bando's cabin, my mountain. Mrs. Strawberry's house and farm, as well as all the buildings in Delhi. My millhouse and tree are not on it, for which I am grateful. I like privacy." (p. 77, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Gradualy the sky darkens and fireflies flash their love lights as the males rise through the trees by the brook." (p. 89, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The parents tend their young until they fly." (p. 90, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "On bare earth in the sun is another compass. This one is different from the first. Alice has propped up a stick at a 45-degree angle to the ground. On it hangs a stone on a string. Under it is a north-south directional stick. Smiling, I recall how Alice and I made a compass like this last spring. We placed a marker on the shadow that the hanging rock cast in the morning. Then, when the sun passed the meridian, we put another marker on the afternoon stone-shadow. Between the two marks and directly under the suspended rock, we laid a stick. We had a north-south line." (p. 92, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "There are no trails or roads up here, so, by lining up trees to keep us going in a straight line, and by reading the quadrangle maps to avoid cliffs and marshes, we strike off across the top of the mountain range. (p. 95, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

We traverse fields and forests, walk through barren lands where quails and woodcocks fly up at our feet, and, after twelve miles of bushwhacking, enter the Plattekill State Forest. We are greeted by a flock of wild turkeys, big, noisy, and glorious. They gobble and fly off, miraculously missing limbs and trunks as they zip through the forest. I could never hit one of those with my sling." (p. 95, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Map reading gives us a good excuse to rest." (p. 96, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'There's a power line below us. It leads to the road at the bottom of Manorkill Falls. It'll be a lot easier to walk on the cleared land under those wires than in this dense forest." (p. 96, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Bando is still bent over the maps. I cleeant he trout and wrap it in May-apple leaves, then dig a hole in the earth and build a fire. When the coals are hot, I push them into the hole, place the fish on them, and cover all with leaves, then soil." (p. 103, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "We find a log and sit down. A woodthrush sings. His song sounds like water spilling down the rocks in a cool, dark forest. As I listen, I thank Alice in spite of myself. Were it not for her, I would not be hearing that glorious song on top of this magnificent gore." (p. 104, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The full moon is rising over the chimneys and gabled rooftops of the little town as I walk up the steps to the Ruffed Grouse Hotel and enter the lobby. At the registration desk I tap a bell and a tall man appears." (p. 109, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "and he stormed and ragged at them through the bars"
* "retaliated by teasing him"
* * "his anger waxed and waned"
* "the mor outrage to his dignity"
* "he accumulated a fund of wrath" (pp. 1-5, The Call of the Wild)

* "'Sacradam!' he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck, 'Dat one dam bully dog! Eh? How moch?'" (p. 7, The Call of the Wild)

* "He was friendly, in a treacherous sort of way, smiling into one's face the while he emditated some underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck's food at the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Francois's whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to Buck ut to recover the bone." (p. 7, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an itnent and silent circle. Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with whcih they were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them. This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneat the bristling mass of bodies." (p. 9, The Call of the Wild)

* "Francois made remarkable progress. Ere they returned to camp he kenw enough to stop at 'ho,' to go ahead at 'mush,' to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

'Tree vair' good dogs.' Francois told Perrault. 'Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt'ing.'" (p. 10, The Call of the Wild)

* "By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect: He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing: and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him aloe. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilt, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave's, was to be left alone, though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition." (p. 10, The Call of the Wild)

* "Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon. Buck was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still more surprisingly was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert, and active, anxious that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight." (p. 12, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was a hard day's run, up the canon, through Sheep Camp, past the Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep, and over the great Chilkoot Divide, which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fill the craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennet, where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring. Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled." (p. 12, The Call of the Wild)

* "Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces." (p. 13, The Call of the Wild)

* "And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him: In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest, and killed their meat as they ran it down. It was not task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness, and the cold, and dark." (p. 14, The Call of the Wild)

* "Close in under the shltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm was it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared." (p. 15, The Call of the Wild)

* "The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs int heir relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling. Francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always singing with the dogs, but it was of small avail." (p. 22, The Call of the Wild)

* "Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent, and kenw that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slpishod and slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a woman. 'Mercedes' the men called her. She was Charles's wife and Hal's sister - a nice family party." (p. 32, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not moved druing the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the wildfowl driving up from the South in cunning wedges that split the air." (p. 39, The Call of the Wild)

* "He had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with ihs sister, or his arms, rather: while Buck was too near dead to be of fruther use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river." (p. 41, The Call of the Wild)

* "Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire, rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate an instnat, while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection." (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed." (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "He sat by John Thornton's fire, a broad-breasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting, tasting the savor of the meat" (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a thing that prayed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survive. Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertsed itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf." (p. 56, The Call of the Wild)

* "Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made. He stood up, listening and scenting. From far way driffted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew them as things heard in that toher world which persisted in his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before." (p. 61, The Call of the Wild)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "living the same day-to-day pattern he had started just after crash" (p. 5, Brian's Winter)

* "In truth he felt relieved when the food was gone. It had softened him, made him want more and more, and he could tell that he was moving mentally away from the woods, his situation. He started to think in terms of the city agian, of hamburgers and malts, and his dreams changed." (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "The plane, [crashing], [dream[ing] many times]" (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "But with the supplies from the plane his dreams changed back to food and when it was gone - in what seemed a very short time - a kind of wanting, hunger returned that he ahd not felt since the first week. For a week or two he was in torment, never satisfied; even when he ahd plenty of  fish and rabbit or foolbird to eat he thought of the things he didn't have. It somehow was never enough and he seemed to be angry all the time, so angry that he wasted a whole day just slamming things around and swearing at his luck." (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "Almost a whiff, soemthing he could smell. He was hutning with the rifle when he sensed the change. He had awakened early, just before first light, and had decided to spend the entire day hunting and get maybe two or three foolbirds. He blew on the coals from the fire the night before until they glowed red, added some bits of dry grass, which burst into flame at once, and heated water in one of the aluminum pots that had come in the plane's survival pack." (p. 7, Brian's Winter)

* "A new coolness, a touch, a soft kiss on his cheek. It was the same air, the same sun, the same morning, but it was different, so changed that he stopped and raised his hand to his cheek and touched where the coolness had brushed him." (p. 7, Brian's Winter)

* "He closed his eyes and went to sleep like a baby." (p. 14, Brian's Winter)

* "He had made many friends - or at least acquaintances. Birds had taken on a special significance for him. At night the owls made their soft sounds, calling each other in almost ghostly hoonnes that scared him until he finally saw one call on a night when the moon was full and so bright it was almost like a cloudy day." (p. 15, Brian's Winter)

* "Before dawn, just as gray light began to filter through the trees, the day birds began to sing. They started slowly but before the gray had become light enough to see ten yards all the birds started to sing and Brian was brought out of sleep by what seemed to be thousands of singing birds." (p. 15, Brian's Winter)

* "Robins had an evening song and one they snag right before a rainstorm and another when the rain was done. Blue jays spent all their time complaining and swearing but they also warned him when something - anything was moving in the wods. Ravens and crows were the same - scrawking and cawing their way through the trees." (p. 16, Brian's Winter)

* "Good, he thought, I own something now. I belong. And he ahd gone on with his life believing that he wolves and he had settled everything." (p. 17, Brian's Winter)

* "Everything in nature means something and he had missed the warnings that summer was ending, had in many ways already ended, and what was coming would be the most dangerous thing he had faced since the plane crash." (p. 21, Brian's Winter)

* "And the sky over the lake was different as well. The soft, summer clouds were gone and where it was blue it was a flat coppery blue and where the clouds were coming they were a slate gray - and they grew as he watched. Not in thuderheads as in the summer, towering and full of drama, but an almost ugly gray that was all one shade, and expanded from the north to cover the sky as if pushed by a large hand. Even as he watched, the patch of blue he had seen at first was gone and all the sky was gray and he could smell rain. Again, not the rain of summer but a cooler, almost cold rain was coming and it made him shiver though it had not started yet." (pp. 24-25, Brian's Winter)

* "Those people were the pros, he thought - the Native Americans who had made the points centuries before. They lived all the time as Brian was trying to live now and they had experimented for thousands of years to come up with the designs of the heads. Brian closed his eyes and tried to remember how they had looked." (p. 27, Brian's Winter)

* "He searched his memory, what he had learned in school, seen on television, read in books, and nowhere could he find a picture of anybody saying how stone arrowheads were made." (p. 27, Brian's Winter)

* "Thigns never happened as he planned, however, and because he was concentrating on looking for rabbits he very nearly stepped on a foolbird. It blew up under his foot in a flash of leaves and feathers like a grenade detonating and flew off at a quartering angle away and to Brian's left front." (p. 29, Brian's Winter)

* "flock of geese" (p. 35, Brian's Winter)

* "It was not finished as well as the ancients ahd finished theirs, but it was sharp and tapered the right way and had a notch for tying it onto the shaft." (p. 39, Brian's Winter)

* "They must have been the wolves that had sung the night before just as he went to sleep. They had hunted well and he smiled, thinking how they must feel - how he felt when it went well - and turned to go to his stump, when he thought again." (p. 45, Brian's Winter)

* "Rabbits were easy to skin - the hide almost fell off them. The doe's skin was stuck tight to the meat and did not come off with simply pullying at it, the way a rabbit skin did. Brian had to use the tip of the knife to cut the skin away form the flesh, peeling it back a quarter of an inch at a time, and it took him the better part of an hour, working constantly, to get the hide loose, cutting it off the front legs and up the neck to the back of the head." (p. 47, Brian's Winter)

* "The entire world was white, bright white with new morning sun glaring off and through it and so intense that it made his temples hurt." (p. 71, Brian's Winter)
* "Snow had fallen in the night. Soft, large flakes, nearly four inches deep everywhere. On limbs, logs, the ground, on the lake ice - all over, an even four inches." (p. 71, Brian's Winter)
* "He moved around, did his toilet - drawing a picture in the snow when he did - and was amazed how well the boots worked, kept his feet warm and comfortable. As he came close to the shelter he saw a mouse appear almost magically out of the snow, run across the surface for three feet and then dive under again." (p. 72, Brian's Winter)

* "Almost simultaneously he saw different tracks in the snow in front of him. Big tracks. Huge tracks. The hair went up on his neck. They were big enough for bear and what he really didn't want to do in his whole life was meat a bear in thick brush, especially if it was a bear that had a memory of a bad night with a skunk." (p. 75, Brian's Winter)

* "Bright opened his eyes slowly, closed them against the brightness and the pain in his forehead, then opened them again." (p. 80, Brian's Winter)

* "He made a fire inside the shelter with coals from the outside fire and soon it was warm and toasty. He hung the rabbit-skin shirt up to dry and lay back to wait the rain out. Having worked all night the previous night and slept most of the day, he wasn't sleepy and thought that the rain seemed light and would probably end by daylight and when he finaly dozed off, warm and snug in the shelter, it seemed to be coming down more lightly all the time." (p. 87, Brian's Winter)

* "He needed wood and he spent most of that day dragging in dead poplar, finally taking the parka off because it was so heavy and working in the rabbit-skin shirt alone. Everything had ice frozen on it but it chipped off easily with the hatchet. When he had a good stack - enough for another week (he was definitly gun-shy now about storms) - he chopped some meat off one of the back legs of the moose for stew and settled in for another night of rubbing the hide of his parka to soften it." (p. 90, Brian's Winter)

* "The berries boiled first and he added snow water to them and kept them boiling until he had a kind of mush in the pan. By that time the meat had cooked and he set it off to the side and tasted the berry mush." (p. 94, Brian's Winter)

* "All that, he thought, all that and more to be thankful for and he ended the prayer - as it had seemed to become - with another thought about the pilot down in the lake, how he hoped the pilot had had a good life and was where it was good for him now." (p. 96, Brian's Winter)

* "Then he ate, quietly, thinking of his mother and father, and when he finished his Thanksgiving it was dark, pitch-dark, and he crawled into his bag to sleep and had just closed his eyes and started to get drowsy when he heard the gunshot." (p. 96, Brian's Winter)

* "He made a circle of the camp, walked out on the lake ice - which was covered with  snow as well - and back around and saw no tracks other than rabbit and mouse. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

Then he started to move toward where the sound had come from, working slowly, amazed that he was starting to warm up and even feel comfortable. Back in the hood the air was kept from moving and his face grew warmer and the fact that his head was warm seemed to warm his whole body and once he became accustomed to the cold he could look around and appreciate the world around him. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

It was a world of beauty. It's like being inside glass, he thought, a beautiful glass crystal. The air was so clear he could see tiny twigs, needles on pine trees fifty, seventy-five yards away, and so still that when a chickadee flew from a tree to the meat piled near the entrace - where they flocked and picked at the meat - he could actually hear the rush of air as the bird flapped its wings." (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

* "But there was moisture in them, sap, and when it got very cold the sap must freeze. He went up to the tree that had just exploded and saw that a whole section seemed to have been blown out of the side - maybe a foot and a half long and four or five inches wide. Just shattered and blown apart and the force seemed to have come from inside the tree and he stood back and stared at the wound and thought on it and finally came up with a theory. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

The tree would freeze on the outside first, a ring of frozen wood all the way around. Then, when it got truly cold - as it had last night - the inside would freeze." (p. 102, Brian's Winter)

* "He did not know how to make the rest of the snowshoe. He had seen pictures and kenw it had to be a web of some sort but could not visualize how to start. In the end he just started in the middle and worked to the ends, tying the strips of moose hide crosswise, fastened to each side, making horizontal strips about two inches apart, each strap pulled tight and tied off in a double knot." (p. 107, Brian's Winter)

* "Home was where he stopped to have a fire and by the end of a week - the warm weather held, rising to thirty above during the day - he actually stayed out away from the shelter for a night and sat by a fire in his clothes, listening to wolves howling, seeing a thousand diamond eyes from the firelight glittering in the snow around the fire pit." (pp. 119-120, Brian's Winter)

* A line // "Brian had discovered that there are almost no straight lines in nature. The sides of trees up and down, the horizon, far away, but very little else. Animal tracks almost always wandered, circled; seldom did they go straight for any distance." (p. 126, Brian's Winter)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "My brother Rabo was only a little boy half my age, which was twelve. He was small for one who had lived so many suns and moons, but quick as cricket. Also foolish, as a cricket when he was excited. For this reason and because I wanted him to help me gather roots and not go running off, I said nothing about the shell I saw or the gull with folded wings." (p. 1, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

"'The sea is not a stone without scratches,' I said. 'It is water and no waves.'" (p. 2, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "But Ramo's eyes missed little in the world. They were black like a lizard's and very large and, like the eyes of a lizard, could sometimes look sleepy." (p. 2, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "I kept on gathering roots, but my hands trembled as I dug in the earth, for I was more excited than my brother. I knew thatit was a ship there on the sea and not a big canoe, and that a ship could mean many things. I wanted to drop the stick and run too, but I went on digging roots because they were needed in the village." (p. 3, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "I was surprised that he gave his real name to a stranger. Everyone in our tribe had two names, the real one which was secret and was seldom used, and one which was common, for if people use your secret name it becomes worn out and loses its magic. Thus I was known as Won-a-pa-lei, which means The Girl with the Long Black Hair, though my secret name is Karnaa. My father's secret name was Chowig. Why he gave it to a stranger I do not know." (p. 5, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Everyone on the beach looked up. Silently I left the toyon bushes and ran without stoppiing until I reached the mesa." (p. 7, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Our island is two leagues long and one league wide, and if you were standing on one of the hills that rise int he middle of it, you would think that it looked like a fish. Like a dolphin lying on its side, with its tail pointing otward the sunrise, its nose pointing to the sunset, and its fins making reefs and the rocky ledges along the shore. Whether someone did stand there on the low hills in the days when the earth was new and, because of tis shape, called it the Island of the Blue Dolphins." (p. 8, Island of the Blue Dolphins) 
* "Many dolphins live in our seas and it may be from them that the name came." (p. 8, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Many of our tribe went to the cliff each night to count the number killed during the day. They counted the dead otter and thought of the beads and other things that each pelt meant. But I never went to the cove and whenever I saw the hunters with their long spears skimming over the water, I was angry, for these animals were my friends. It was fun to see them playing or sunning themselves among the kelp. It was mreo fun thant the htought of beads to wear around my neck." (p. 15, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "There are no trees on the island except the small ones stunted by the wind. When a log came ashore, as happened once in a long time, it was always carried to the village and worked on where a chance wave could not wash it away. That the men were sent to hollow out the log in the cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the Aleuts, to give the alarm should Captain Orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins." (p. 16, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The wind blew in fierce gusts as we left the village, stinging our faces with sand. Rmao hopped along far in front with one of our baskets, but before long he ran back to say that he had forgotten his fishing spear. Nanko was standing on the cliff motioning us to hurry, so I refused to let him go back for it." (p. 35, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The sails had filed and the ship was now moving slowly away. Everyone was looking toward the cliff, even the white men. I ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. The ship began to move faster. Against my will, I screamed." (p. 37, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

(p. 39, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

I stood on the, bracing myself against the waves, so that I would not have to look for it again. When the tide turned I began to dig with my feet, working them down and down, and then with my hands." (p. 50, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "In the morning the gulls flew out from their nests in the crevices of the cliff. THey circled down to the tide pools where they stood first on one leg and then the other, splasing waterover themselves and combing their feathers with curved beaks.

From the sunny cliffs, in crevices where no one would think anything could grow, sprang the little read and yellow fountains of the comul bush." (p. 108, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

Red-winged blackbirds also came flying out of the south, and flocks of crows, and a bird with a yellow body and a scarlet head, which I had never seen before." (pp. 108-109, Island of the Blue Dolphin)

* "The pull suddenly lessened and I was sure that he was gone, but the next instant I saw the string cutting the water in a wide circle.

(p. 117, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The sun made bright scales on the water, but I could see clearly. There were two sails and it was a ship coming toward the island. For a long time I could not tell the color fo the sails.

* "The sea water kept the abalones fresh, but when we had to go out again the night was took dark to find our way to the reef. I therefore had to gather roots. I could never gather many before the sun rose, so I went tou every monring until the next moon came. Then I went to the reef for abalones." (p. 129, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "My heart beat loud" (p. 138, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

He did Little Bear's gruff voice and had a stab at Boone's Texas accent; when he said something funny, the whole auditorium erupted with laughter.

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
"At moments like this, he would remember Little Bear. Little Bear had been only a fraction of Omi's size, and yet he had stood up to him. If he had felt scared, as Omri did now, he never showed it. Omri was not that much smaller than these boys. There were just so many of them, and only one of him. But imagine if they'd been giants, as he was to Little Bear. They were nothing but kids like himself, although several years older. Except that they weren't like 'Pigs. Toads. Mad dogs.' It would be shameful to let them see he was afraid of them. He gripped his schoolba tightly by both handles and came on." (p. 3, The Return of the Indian)

* "An experience lik that taught you something. He fled, hating himself but hating his enemies worse. They didn't pursue him. That would have been too much trouble. But their shouts and jeers followed him all the way to his gate." (p. 5, The Return of the Indian)

By the time they'd reached the station it was almost as if Patrick ahd never gone away, as if they were still as close as they used to be. That was why Omri didn't hesitate to say, 'Where do you keep Boone and his horse?'" (p. 7, The Return of the Indian)

* "It's lonely having a secret like that. If Patrick hand'tmoved away, if they could have kept talking about it and remembering together, then he'd never have denie it, or started trying to pretend it never happened." (p. 8, The Return of the Indian)

* "communed with her, eyeball to eyeball" (p. 10, The Return of the Indian)

* "In the old house, his bedroom had been just one of several opening off the upstairs landing, and at certain times of the day had been like a railway station. His new room was off the beaten track. No one (in his opinion) had any reason to come up here, or even pass the door. There were times, now that he had it all arranged to suit himself, when he forgot about how awful it was living in Hovel Road, when it seemed wroth anything to have a room like this." 9p. 17, The Return of the Indian)

* "Put any plastic object - an ax, an India tepee, a quiver of arrows - into it, close the door, turn the key... and those things became real - miniature but real. Real leather, real cloth, real steel. Put the plastic figures of human beings or animals inside, and in the time it took to lock them in, they, too, became real. Real and live. And not just 'living toys', but people from another time, from their own lives, with their own personalities and needs and demands." (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)
* "Cabinet's magic properties" (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)

* "By putting their plastic figures into the magic cupboard, by turning the magic key, Omri had the power to recall them to life. To youth. He could snatch them from the past. The whole business nearly blew Omri's mind every time he thought at all deeply about it. So he tried not to think about it too much. And to prevent his yielding to temptaiton, he had given his mother the key. She wore it around her neck on a chain (it was quite decorative). People often asked her about it, and she would say, 'It's Omri's really, but he lends it to me.' That wasn't the whole truth. Omri had pressed it on her and begged her to keep it safe for him. Safe...not just getting lost again, but safe from him, from his longing to use it again; to reactivate the magic, to bring back his friends. To bring back the time when he had been - not happiest, but most intensely, dangerously alive himself." (pp. 22-23, The Return of the Indian)

* "His story was original. Adiel had relieved his mind up, if you had the experience, and you wrote about it, it was original. So he hadn't cheated. But the story wasn't only his. It also belonged to the little men - to Little Bear, and Boone, and even to Tommy, the World War I soldier. (It belonged to Patrick, too, but if Patrick had decided to deny it ever happened, then he'd given up his rights in it.)" (p. 28, The Return of the Indian)
* "Ande Boone - the 'crying cowboy' with a talent for art, a deep dislike of washing, and a heavy thirst..." (p. 29, The Return of the Indian)

* "She nodded fiercely. 'Women see. Soldier come village. Braves fight. Soldier make fire in house. Kill many. Take prisoner. Braves chase. Out, out - far! Bright Stars hide. See Little Bear fall. See soldier '" 'Bright Stars run, catch pony, bring Little Bear home to village. All fire! Dead brave! Woman cry I shut eyes, now see.'" (p. 38, The Return of the Indian)

* "There was a good deal of swearing, jeering, and shsoving. A scuffle started." (p. 53, The Return of the Indian)

* "'You try explaining to a whole bunch of soldiers who're probably in the middle of World War II or in Northenr Ireland, that they're not to fight the Nazis or the IRA, they're to go off and shoot eighteenth-century Frenchmen in the middle of New York!" (p. 94, The Return of the Indian)

* "loads of Indians", Iroquois, Little Bear, sort of clothes (p. 94, The Return of the Indian)

* "Now-soldiers no good. But now-guns good. Get Iroquois brave, plass-tick, many, many, then give braves now-guns like one make hole in bed.'" (p. 95, The Return of the Indian)

* "Omri knew how bitter the hatred between warring tribes could be. The Algonquins, for instance, were the Iroquois's mortal enemies - it would be no use bringing any of them. But since there weren't anything like enough that he was sure were Iroquois. Omri had brough some others he wasn't sure of, in the home that Little Bear would recognize them as belonging to some friendly Indian nation who would agree to help the Iroquois in their hour of trial." (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* English soldiers; differing periods; the French in America; Omri, "keen on brining any white men into it' (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* "She put the glove-finger around him tot he armpits while Boone ran up the ramp and puled it up behind him. The two ponies were munching grass in their frenced-off paddock. Omri picked the whole thing up, while Patrick took the cupboard and the bag of new men. As an afterhtought he slipped Matron in his pocket. Omri did a quick reconnaissance to see that nobody was around. The they cautiously trooped down the stairs and out the kitchen door into the back garden.

It was really a lovely place, far better than their old garden. It was not just a rectangle of lawn with a few flower beds. It had nooks and crannies. Omri headed for his favorite corner, a clump of bushes with a patch of grass in the middle, where rhododendrons and other tall plants kept prying eyes at bay. The sun was high and the place was sheltered from the wind. Still, Omri suggested Little Bear should be put into the longhouse to keep warm." (p. 100, The Return of the Indian)

* "'More like Indian. Earth colors. Like leaf. Shadow. More good for hide. Jump out on enemy. Whit man learn much from Indian.'" (p. 103, The Return of the Indian)

* "the idea of machine guns running amok with the idea of Indinas" "grenades and artillery" (p. 117, The Return of the Indian)

When the hickory nuts, walnuts, and acorns appeared, I was going to need a bin. You'd be surprised what a pile of nuts it takes to make one turtle shell full of nut meants - and not a snapping-turtle shell either, just a box-turtle shell!" (p. 63)

"This was tedius work, too, but now that I had a home and smoked venison and did not have to hunt food every minute, I could do things like make flour.

I liked them, and would carry the leftovers in my pcokets for lunch." (p. 67)

His home, his life - all the solid things. Divorce. A breaking word, an ugly breaking word. Divorce. Secrets." [Divorce] (pp. 2-3)

* "pain come and go in waves" [Description of Pain] (p. 34)


* "Everything was green, so green it went into him. The forest was largely made up of pines and spruce, with stands of some low brush smeared here and there and thick grass and some other kind of very small brush all over. He couldn't identify most of it - except the evergreens - and some leafy trees he thought might be aspen. He'd seen pictures of aspens in the mountains on tele-vision. The country around the lake was moderately hilly, but the hills were small - almost hummocks - and there were very few rocks except to his left. There lay a rocky ridge that stuck out overlooking the lake, about twenty feet high." [Nature] (p. 37)
* "bird sounds of the forest" [Nature] (p. 37)
* "The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun." [Nature, Trees]


* "The birds landed in some taller willow type of undergrowth with wide leaves and started jumping and making noise. At first he was too far away to see what they were doing, but their color drew him and he moved toward them, keeping the lake in sight on his right, and when he got closer he saw they were eating the berries."

Shining black and silky the bear stood on its hind legs, half up, and studied Brian, just studied him, then lowered itself and moved slowly to the left, eating berries as it rolled along, wuffling and delicately using its mouth to lift each berry from the stem, and in seconds it was gone. Gone, and Brian still had not moved. His tongue was stuck to the top of his mouth, the tip half out, his eyes were wide and his hands were reaching for a berry." [Experience with Nature] (p. 70)
* "Then he made a sound, a low: 'Nnnnnnggg.' It made no sense, was just a sound of fear, of disbelief" [Sound] (p. 70)

* "He smiled. City boy, he thought. Oh, you city boy with your city ways - he made a mirror in his mind, a mirror of himself, and saw how he must look. City boy with your city ways sitting in the sand trying to read the tracks and not knowing, not understanding. Why would anything wild come up from the water to play in the sand? Not that way, animals weren't that way. They didn't waste time that way." [City Boy] (p. 93)


* "Mistakes. Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death. In the city if he made a mistake usually there was a way to rectify it, make it all right. If he fell on his bike and sprained a leg he could wait for it to heal; if he forgot something at the store he could find other food in the refrigerator." [Mistakes, Disasters] (p. 121)
* "Mistakes. He tried to learn from the mistakes. He couldn't bury food again, couldn't leave it in the shelter, because something like a bear could get at it right away. It had to be high, somehow, high and safe." [Mistakes, Learning] (pp. 125-126)


* "The days ahd folded one into another and mixed so that after two or three weeks he only knew time had passed in days because he made a mark for each day in stone near the door to his shelter. Real time he measured in events. A day was nothing, not a thing to remember - it was just sun coming up, sun going down, some light in the middle." [Days Folding Into One Another] (p. 129)

* "the birds could fly amazingly fast, get up fast" [Birds Flying] (p. 134)


* "Pushing the raft, he figured, was about like trying to push an aircraft carrier. All the branches that stuck down into the water dragged and pulled and the logs themselves fought any forward motion and he hadn't gone twenty feet when he realized that it was going to be much harder than he thought to get the raft to the plane. It barely moved and if he kept going this way he would just about reach the plane at dark. He decided to turn back again, spend the night and start early in the morning, and pulled the raft once more onto the sand and wide-scraped it dry with his hand." [The Raft, Experience] (p. 157)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "If the Indian *were* real, and not just - well, moving plastic, as Pinocchio had been moving wood, then he would need food and other things. And Omri had left him shut up in the dark all day with nothing. Perhaps - what if there were not enough air for him in that cupboard? The door fitted very tight. How much air would such a very small creature need? What if - what if the Indian were - what if he'd *died*, shut up there? What if Omri had killed him?" (pp. 18-19) [Interaction with the Indian, Imagination]

* "Biscuits, jam, peanut butter, that sort of thing was no problem, but somehow Omri felt sure these were not Indian foods. Suddenly his searching eyes fell on an open tin of sweet corn. He found a paper plat in the drawer where the picnic stuff lived, and took a good teaspoonful of corn. Then he broke off a crusty corner of bread. Then he thought of some cheese. And what about a drink? Milk? Surely Indian braves did not drink milk? They usually drank something called 'firewater' in films, which was presumably a hot drink, and Omri dared not heat anything. Ordinary non-firewater would have to do, unless...What about some Coke? That was an American drink. Lucky there was a bit in a big bottle left over from his birthday, so he took that. He did wish there was some cold meat, but there just wasn't." (p. 23) [Foot, Descriptions]

* "'Not want toy,' said the Indian" (p. 28) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Little Bear not lie. Great hunter. Great fighter.'" (p. 38) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Some. French. Not take English scalps. Englishmenf riends to Iroquois. Help Indian fight Algonquin enemy.'" (p. 37) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Down in the kitchen he ransacked his mother's store cupboard for a tin of meat. He found some corned beef at last and opened it with the tin opener on the wall." (p. 39) [Ransacked]

* "In a moment he had vaulted over the bottom edge of the cupboard and, as the horse reared in fright, jumped into the air under its flying hooves and grasped the leather reins. The horse fought to free its head, but Little Bear hung on with both hands. Even as the horse plunged and bucked, the Indian had moved from the front to the side. Grasping the high pommel of the saddle, he swung himself into it. He ignored teh swinging stirrups, holding on by gripping with his knees." (p 43) [Relationship with horse]

* "The selection of plastic figures there was good. There was one whole box of mixed cowboys and Indians. Omri searched till he found a chief wearing a cloak and a full feather headdress, with a bow in his hand and a quiverful of arrows slung across his back. Omri brought it with part of his lunch money and rushed back to school before he could be missed." (p. 65) [Plastic Figures]

* "'Little Bear isn't a toy. He's a real man. He really lived. Maybe he's still - I don't know - he's in the middle of his life - somewhere in America in seventeen-something-or-other. He's from the *past*,' Omri struggled to explain as Patrick looked blank." (p. 86) [Plastic Figures, Real, Live]

* "Meanwhile he was scraping the dry beans off the plate with his nails. He took the fragment of firelighter and the twigs out of his pocket and arranged them in the center of the plate. He washed the bit of meat in his bedside water glass. He'd had a wonderful idea for a spit to cook it on. From a flat box in which his first Erector set had once been neatly laid out, but which was now in chaos, he took a rod, ready bent into a handle shape, and pushed this through the meat. Then, from small bits of the set, he quickly made a sort of stand for it to rest on, with legs each side of the fire so that the meat hung over the middle of it." (p 91) [Adventures]

* "'You no Great Spirit! Only stupid boy! Fight, spoil good meal! You feel shame!'" (p. 94) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "'Peace of Great Spirits be with you'" (p. 111) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "The cowboy looked at it, looked up at. Omri, then, stood up and put the hat on. 'You shore ain't no reg'lar hallucy-nation,' he said. 'I'm obliged to ya.' Suddenly he laughed. 'Jest imagine, thankin' a piece o'yer dee-lirium tremens fer givin' you yer hat back! Ah jest cain't figger out what's goin' on around here. Say! Are you real, or was that Injun real? 'Cause in case you ain't noticed, you're a daned sight bigger'n he is. You cain't both be real.'" (p. 119) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Omri ate his cereal in silence, grinning to himself, hugging his secret. He slipped a couple of cornflakes into his pockets." (p. 133) [Omri's innocence, childlike eating]

* "Little Bear and Omri watched. From the microscopic point of Boone's pencil there developed a most amazing scene. It was a prairie landscape, with ills and cacti and a few tufts of sagebrush. Boone sketched in, with sure strokes, some wooden buildings such as Omri had often seen in cowboy films - a saloon with a swinging sign reading 'Golden Dollar Saloon' in twirly writing; a post office and general store, a lively stable, and a stone house with a barred window and a sing saying 'Jail.' Then, moving swiftly on his knees, as it were from one end of his 'street' to another, Boone drew in the foreground - figures of men and women, wagons, horses, dogs, and all the trappings of a little town." (p. 163) [Omri's engagement with Boone, Little Bear, drawing, Western]
