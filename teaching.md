### I have started reading children's books, and developing outlines for critically reading them. I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to teach critical reading of children's books to little ones. I hope to share outlines below. ###

The top three books for children I have read are "Where the Wild Fern Grows", "Hatchet", "Mandy", and "The Indian in the Cupboard". 
Other children's books authors of interest include Thornton Burgess and Laura Ingalls Wilder.

His home, his life - all the solid things. Divorce. A breaking word, an ugly breaking word. Divorce. Secrets." [Divorce] (pp. 2-3)

* "I'm alive, he thought. I'm alive. It could have been different. There could have been death. I could have been done." [Alive, Waking up]

* "pain come and go in waves" [Description of Pain] (p. 34)


* "Everything was green, so green it went into him. The forest was largely made up of pines and spruce, with stands of some low brush smeared here and there and thick grass and some other kind of very small brush all over. He couldn't identify most of it - except the evergreens - and some leafy trees he thought might be aspen. He'd seen pictures of aspens in the mountains on tele-vision.

* "The sun caught the ends of the hairs along his back. Shining black and silky the bear stood on its hind legs, half up, and studied Brian, just studied him, then lowered itself and moved slowly to the left, eating berries as it rolled along, wuffling and delicately using its mouth to lift each berry from the stem, and in seconds it was gone. Gone, and Brian still had not moved. His tongue was stuck to the top of his mouth, the tip half out, his eyes were wide and his hands were reaching for a berry." [Experience with Nature] (p. 70)

* "The days ahd folded one into another and mixed so that after two or three weeks he only knew time had passed in days because he made a mark for each day in stone near the door to his shelter. Real time he measured in events. A day was nothing, not a thing to remember - it was just sun coming up, sun going down, some light in the middle." [Days Folding Into One Another] (p. 129)

* "the birds could fly amazingly fast, get up fast" [Birds Flying] (p. 134)


* "Pushing the raft, he figured, was about like trying to push an aircraft carrier. All the branches that stuck down into the water dragged and pulled and the logs themselves fought any forward motion and he hadn't gone twenty feet when he realized that it was going to be much harder than he thought to get the raft to the plane. It barely moved and if he kept going this way he would just about reach the plane at dark. He decided to turn back again, spend the night and start early in the morning, and pulled the raft once more onto the sand and wide-scraped it dry with his hand." [The Raft, Experience] (p. 157)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "If the Indian *were* real, and not just - well, moving plastic, as Pinocchio had been moving wood, then he would need food and other things. And Omri had left him shut up in the dark all day with nothing. Perhaps - what if there were not enough air for him in that cupboard? The door fitted very tight. How much air would such a very small creature need? What if - what if the Indian were - what if he'd *died*, shut up there? What if Omri had killed him?" (pp. 18-19) [Interaction with the Indian, Imagination]

* "Biscuits, jam, peanut butter, that sort of thing was no problem, but somehow Omri felt sure these were not Indian foods. Suddenly his searching eyes fell on an open tin of sweet corn. He found a paper plat in the drawer where the picnic stuff lived, and took a good teaspoonful of corn. Then he broke off a crusty corner of bread. Then he thought of some cheese. And what about a drink? Milk? Surely Indian braves did not drink milk? They usually drank something called 'firewater' in films, which was presumably a hot drink, and Omri dared not heat anything. Ordinary non-firewater would have to do, unless...What about some Coke? That was an American drink. Lucky there was a bit in a big bottle left over from his birthday, so he took that. He did wish there was some cold meat, but there just wasn't." (p. 23) [Foot, Descriptions]

* "'Not want toy,' said the Indian" (p. 28) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Little Bear not lie. Great hunter. Great fighter.'" (p. 38) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "In a moment he had vaulted over the bottom edge of the cupboard and, as the horse reared in fright, jumped into the air under its flying hooves and grasped the leather reins. The horse fought to free its head, but Little Bear hung on with both hands. Even as the horse plunged and bucked, the Indian had moved from the front to the side. Grasping the high pommel of the saddle, he swung himself into it. He ignored teh swinging stirrups, holding on by gripping with his knees." (p 43) [Relationship with horse]

* "The selection of plastic figures there was good. There was one whole box of mixed cowboys and Indians. Omri searched till he found a chief wearing a cloak and a full feather headdress, with a bow in his hand and a quiverful of arrows slung across his back. Omri brought it with part of his lunch money and rushed back to school before he could be missed." (p. 65) [Plastic Figures]

* "'Little Bear isn't a toy. He's a real man. He really lived. Maybe he's still - I don't know - he's in the middle of his life - somewhere in America in seventeen-something-or-other. He's from the *past*,' Omri struggled to explain as Patrick looked blank." (p. 86) [Plastic Figures, Real, Live]

* "Meanwhile he was scraping the dry beans off the plate with his nails. He took the fragment of firelighter and the twigs out of his pocket and arranged them in the center of the plate. He washed the bit of meat in his bedside water glass. He'd had a wonderful idea for a spit to cook it on. From a flat box in which his first Erector set had once been neatly laid out, but which was now in chaos, he took a rod, ready bent into a handle shape, and pushed this through the meat. Then, from small bits of the set, he quickly made a sort of stand for it to rest on, with legs each side of the fire so that the meat hung over the middle of it." (p 91) [Adventures]

* "'Peace of Great Spirits be with you'" (p. 111) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "The cowboy looked at it, looked up at. Omri, then, stood up and put the hat on. 'You shore ain't no reg'lar hallucy-nation,' he said. 'I'm obliged to ya.' Suddenly he laughed. 'Jest imagine, thankin' a piece o'yer dee-lirium tremens fer givin' you yer hat back! Ah jest cain't figger out what's goin' on around here. Say! Are you real, or was that Injun real? 'Cause in case you ain't noticed, you're a daned sight bigger'n he is. You cain't both be real.'" (p. 119) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Omri ate his cereal in silence, grinning to himself, hugging his secret. He slipped a couple of cornflakes into his pockets." (p. 133) [Omri's innocence, childlike eating]

* "Little Bear and Omri watched. From the microscopic point of Boone's pencil there developed a most amazing scene. It was a prairie landscape, with ills and cacti and a few tufts of sagebrush. Boone sketched in, with sure strokes, some wooden buildings such as Omri had often seen in cowboy films - a saloon with a swinging sign reading 'Golden Dollar Saloon' in twirly writing; a post office and general store, a lively stable, and a stone house with a barred window and a sing saying 'Jail.' Then, moving swiftly on his knees, as it were from one end of his 'street' to another, Boone drew in the foreground - figures of men and women, wagons, horses, dogs, and all the trappings of a little town." (p. 163) [Omri's engagement with Boone, Little Bear, drawing, Western]
