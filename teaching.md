### I have started reading children's books, and developing outlines for critically reading them. I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to teach critical reading of children's books to little ones. I hope to share outlines below. ###

The top three books for children I have read are "Where the Wild Fern Grows", "Hatchet", and "Mandy".

* When it comes to the topic of  ______________, most of us will agree that  ______________. Where the agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of  ______________. Whereas some are convincted that  ______________, others maintain that  ______________.
* In conclusion, then, as I suggested earlier, defenders of  ______________ can't have it both ways. Their assertion that  ______________ is contradicted by their claim that  ______________.

### Capturing Authorial Intent ###
Argues. Acknowledges. Believes. Denies/Does Not Deny. Claims. Complains. Concedes. Demonstrates. Deplores. Celebrates. Emphasizes. Insists. Observes. Questions. Refutes. Reminds. Reports. Suggests. Urges.

* While X is probably wrong when she claims that  ______________, she is right that  ______________.

* However, does the evidence I have cited prove conclusively that  ______________?
* 'Impossible,' you say. 'Your evidence must be skewed.'

### Making Concessions While Still Standing Your Ground ###
* Although I grant that  ______________, I still maintain that  ______________.

* Provide the linking language that ties your claim to the ideas of the documents and back to your thesis.
* Control the documents, and list the facts. Start and end always with claims and analysis.
* Conclude with the "so what?" issue, and lead educated, informed citizens to continue to think about the issue at hand.
