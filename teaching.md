### I have started reading children's books, and developing outlines for critically reading them. I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to teach critical reading of children's books to little ones. I hope to share outlines below. ###

The top three books for children I have read are "Where the Wild Fern Grows", "Hatchet", "Mandy", "The Indian in the Cupboard", "Mr. Popper's Penguins". 
Other children's books authors of interest include Thornton Burgess and Laura Ingalls Wilder.

The son of a chief of the Iroquois tribe, a fighter, a hunter, with his own history and his own culture. His own beliefs and morals. His own brand of courage." (p. 19, The Secret of the Indian)

* "Little Bear regarded Omri as a magic being, a giant from the world of the spirits, and was at first terrified of him. Omri could see he was afraid, but the Indian was incredibly brave and controlled, and Omri soon began to admire him. He realized he couldn't treat him just as a toy - he was a person to be respected, despite his tiny size and relative helplesness." (p. 19, The Secret of the Indian)

* "Patrick's face was blank for a moment, and Omri thought, Hes scared, and who can blame him! But then he saw it wasn't that all. Patrick simply hadn't been able to grasp the idea at first.

He stared awhile longer, and then shook himself and said brightly. 'Hey, 'Ah'm feelin' better every minute. Y' know, thur ain't nothin like bein' close to a beautiful female fer bringing a red-blooded dyin' man back t' th' land o' the livin'! Unelss it's...' And he gave a meaningful swallow."

* "The story was based on his first meeting with the Indian, a year ago when he'd first discovered the cupboard and the key's magic. It was a great story, and he'd done his best to write it well. At first when he began to read it, he was nervous and stumbled over the words, but after a paragraph or two he hit his stride and began to read with feeling and expression. He did Little Bear's gruff voice and had a stab at Boone's Texas accent; when he said something funny, the whole auditorium erupted with laughter. During the exciting bits everyone sat poised to catch what came next. It was very satifsying, and when he finished the story and the applause broke out again, with some cheering, Omri felt this was a great moment in his life" (p. 115, The Secret of the Indian)

* "wars, guns, bows, arrows"

* "'That's all Ah needed,' he remarked bitterly, wincing as he felt himself all over. 'As if it wasn't enough t' lsoe mah hat, an' git crushed half to death by m' best buddy' - he gave Patrick a dirty look - 'I git blown almost up to the pearly gates, and instead o' findin' m'self on a nice soft pink cloud, I'm hangin' out there in space yellin' my haid off with not a livin' soul takin' a danged bit o' notice till it's nearly Too Late!' And he wiped away a tear. He scowled around darkly and then changed his tone. 'Say, whut hit this place, anyhow? Musta bin some dynamitin' that went wrong.'" (p. 150, The Secret of the Indian)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
"At moments like this, he would remember Little Bear. Little Bear had been only a fraction of Omi's size, and yet he had stood up to him. If he had felt scared, as Omri did now, he never showed it. Omri was not that much smaller than these boys. There were just so many of them, and only one of him. But imagine if they'd been giants, as he was to Little Bear. They were nothing but kids like himself, although several years older. Except that they weren't like 'Pigs. Toads. Mad dogs.' It would be shameful to let them see he was afraid of them. He gripped his schoolba tightly by both handles and came on." (p. 3, The Return of the Indian)

* "An experience lik that taught you something. He fled, hating himself but hating his enemies worse. They didn't pursue him. That would have been too much trouble. But their shouts and jeers followed him all the way to his gate." (p. 5, The Return of the Indian)

* "They chatted on rather awkwardly, with some silences, but it got better. By the time they'd reached the station it was almost as if Patrick ahd never gone away, as if they were still as close as they used to be. That was why Omri didn't hesitate to say, 'Where do you keep Boone and his horse?'" (p. 7, The Return of the Indian)

* "It's lonely having a secret like that. If Patrick hand'tmoved away, if they could have kept talking about it and remembering together, then he'd never have denie it, or started trying to pretend it never happened." (p. 8, The Return of the Indian)

* "communed with her, eyeball to eyeball" (p. 10, The Return of the Indian)

* "read the story aloud" (p. 13, The Return of the Indian)

* "Omri's head began to spin with the incredible excitement of it. He jumped up." (p. 13, The Return of the Indian)

* "The Iroquois were a tribe ferocious in war, stalward in alliance, magnanimous in victory" (p. 15, The Return of the Indian)

* "In the old house, his bedroom had been just one of several opening off the upstairs landing, and at certain times of the day had been like a railway station. His new room was off the beaten track. No one (in his opinion) had any reason to come up here, or even pass the door. There were times, now that he had it all arranged to suit himself, when he forgot about how awful it was living in Hovel Road, when it seemed wroth anything to have a room like this." 9p. 17, The Return of the Indian)

* "Put any plastic object - an ax, an India tepee, a quiver of arrows - into it, close the door, turn the key... and those things became real - miniature but real. Real leather, real cloth, real steel. Put the plastic figures of human beings or animals inside, and in the time it took to lock them in, they, too, became real. Real and live. And not just 'living toys', but people from another time, from their own lives, with their own personalities and needs and demands." (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)
* "Cabinet's magic properties" (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)

* "By putting their plastic figures into the magic cupboard, by turning the magic key, Omri had the power to recall them to life. To youth. He could snatch them from the past. The whole business nearly blew Omri's mind every time he thought at all deeply about it. So he tried not to think about it too much. And to prevent his yielding to temptaiton, he had given his mother the key. She wore it around her neck on a chain (it was quite decorative). People often asked her about it, and she would say, 'It's Omri's really, but he lends it to me.' That wasn't the whole truth. Omri had pressed it on her and begged her to keep it safe for him. Safe...not just getting lost again, but safe from him, from his longing to use it again; to reactivate the magic, to bring back his friends. To bring back the time when he had been - not happiest, but most intensely, dangerously alive himself." (pp. 22-23, The Return of the Indian)

* "His story was original. Adiel had relieved his mind up, if you had the experience, and you wrote about it, it was original. So he hadn't cheated. But the story wasn't only his. It also belonged to the little men - to Little Bear, and Boone, and even to Tommy, the World War I soldier. (It belonged to Patrick, too, but if Patrick had decided to deny it ever happened, then he'd given up his rights in it.)" (p. 28, The Return of the Indian)

* "Omri knew how bitter the hatred between warring tribes could be. The Algonquins, for instance, were the Iroquois's mortal enemies - it would be no use bringing any of them. But since there weren't anything like enough that he was sure were Iroquois. Omri had brough some others he wasn't sure of, in the home that Little Bear would recognize them as belonging to some friendly Indian nation who would agree to help the Iroquois in their hour of trial." (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* English soldiers; differing periods; the French in America; Omri, "keen on brining any white men into it' (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* "She put the glove-finger around him tot he armpits while Boone ran up the ramp and puled it up behind him. The two ponies were munching grass in their frenced-off paddock. Omri picked the whole thing up, while Patrick took the cupboard and the bag of new men. As an afterhtought he slipped Matron in his pocket. Omri did a quick reconnaissance to see that nobody was around. The they cautiously trooped down the stairs and out the kitchen door into the back garden.

It was really a lovely place, far better than their old garden. It was not just a rectangle of lawn with a few flower beds. It had nooks and crannies. Omri headed for his favorite corner, a clump of bushes with a patch of grass in the middle, where rhododendrons and other tall plants kept prying eyes at bay. The sun was high and the place was sheltered from the wind. Still, Omri suggested Little Bear should be put into the longhouse to keep warm." (p. 100, The Return of the Indian)

When the hickory nuts, walnuts, and acorns appeared, I was going to need a bin. You'd be surprised what a pile of nuts it takes to make one turtle shell full of nut meants - and not a snapping-turtle shell either, just a box-turtle shell!" (p. 63)

His home, his life - all the solid things. Divorce. A breaking word, an ugly breaking word. Divorce. Secrets." [Divorce] (pp. 2-3)

* "I'm alive, he thought. I'm alive. It could have been different. There could have been death. I could have been done." [Alive, Waking up]

* "pain come and go in waves" [Description of Pain] (p. 34)


* "Everything was green, so green it went into him. The forest was largely made up of pines and spruce, with stands of some low brush smeared here and there and thick grass and some other kind of very small brush all over. He couldn't identify most of it - except the evergreens - and some leafy trees he thought might be aspen. He'd seen pictures of aspens in the mountains on tele-vision. The country around the lake was moderately hilly, but the hills were small - almost hummocks - and there were very few rocks except to his left. There lay a rocky ridge that stuck out overlooking the lake, about twenty feet high." [Nature] (p. 37)
* "bird sounds of the forest" [Nature] (p. 37)
* "The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun." [Nature, Trees]

* "The sun caught the ends of the hairs along his back. Shining black and silky the bear stood on its hind legs, half up, and studied Brian, just studied him, then lowered itself and moved slowly to the left, eating berries as it rolled along, wuffling and delicately using its mouth to lift each berry from the stem, and in seconds it was gone. Gone, and Brian still had not moved. His tongue was stuck to the top of his mouth, the tip half out, his eyes were wide and his hands were reaching for a berry." [Experience with Nature] (p. 70)
* "Then he made a sound, a low: 'Nnnnnnggg.' It made no sense, was just a sound of fear, of disbelief" [Sound] (p. 70)


* "He swung harder, held the hatchet so it would hit a longer, sliding blow, and the black rock exploded in fire. Sparkes flew so heavily that several of them skittered and jumped on the sand beneath the rock and he smiled and struck again and again." [The Hatchet] (p. 81)


* "He smiled. City boy, he thought. Oh, you city boy with your city ways - he made a mirror in his mind, a mirror of himself, and saw how he must look. City boy with your city ways sitting in the sand trying to read the tracks and not knowing, not understanding. Why would anything wild come up from the water to play in the sand? Not that way, animals weren't that way. They didn't waste time that way." [City Boy] (p. 93)


* "Mistakes. Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death. In the city if he made a mistake usually there was a way to rectify it, make it all right. If he fell on his bike and sprained a leg he could wait for it to heal; if he forgot something at the store he could find other food in the refrigerator." [Mistakes, Disasters] (p. 121)
* "Mistakes. He tried to learn from the mistakes. He couldn't bury food again, couldn't leave it in the shelter, because something like a bear could get at it right away. It had to be high, somehow, high and safe." [Mistakes, Learning] (pp. 125-126)


* "The days ahd folded one into another and mixed so that after two or three weeks he only knew time had passed in days because he made a mark for each day in stone near the door to his shelter. Real time he measured in events. A day was nothing, not a thing to remember - it was just sun coming up, sun going down, some light in the middle." [Days Folding Into One Another] (p. 129)

* "the birds could fly amazingly fast, get up fast" [Birds Flying] (p. 134)


* "Pushing the raft, he figured, was about like trying to push an aircraft carrier. All the branches that stuck down into the water dragged and pulled and the logs themselves fought any forward motion and he hadn't gone twenty feet when he realized that it was going to be much harder than he thought to get the raft to the plane. It barely moved and if he kept going this way he would just about reach the plane at dark. He decided to turn back again, spend the night and start early in the morning, and pulled the raft once more onto the sand and wide-scraped it dry with his hand." [The Raft, Experience] (p. 157)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "If the Indian *were* real, and not just - well, moving plastic, as Pinocchio had been moving wood, then he would need food and other things. And Omri had left him shut up in the dark all day with nothing. Perhaps - what if there were not enough air for him in that cupboard? The door fitted very tight. How much air would such a very small creature need? What if - what if the Indian were - what if he'd *died*, shut up there? What if Omri had killed him?" (pp. 18-19) [Interaction with the Indian, Imagination]

* "Biscuits, jam, peanut butter, that sort of thing was no problem, but somehow Omri felt sure these were not Indian foods. Suddenly his searching eyes fell on an open tin of sweet corn. He found a paper plat in the drawer where the picnic stuff lived, and took a good teaspoonful of corn. Then he broke off a crusty corner of bread. Then he thought of some cheese. And what about a drink? Milk? Surely Indian braves did not drink milk? They usually drank something called 'firewater' in films, which was presumably a hot drink, and Omri dared not heat anything. Ordinary non-firewater would have to do, unless...What about some Coke? That was an American drink. Lucky there was a bit in a big bottle left over from his birthday, so he took that. He did wish there was some cold meat, but there just wasn't." (p. 23) [Foot, Descriptions]

* "'Not want toy,' said the Indian" (p. 28) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Little Bear not lie. Great hunter. Great fighter.'" (p. 38) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Some. French. Not take English scalps. Englishmenf riends to Iroquois. Help Indian fight Algonquin enemy.'" (p. 37) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Down in the kitchen he ransacked his mother's store cupboard for a tin of meat. He found some corned beef at last and opened it with the tin opener on the wall." (p. 39) [Ransacked]

* "In a moment he had vaulted over the bottom edge of the cupboard and, as the horse reared in fright, jumped into the air under its flying hooves and grasped the leather reins. The horse fought to free its head, but Little Bear hung on with both hands. Even as the horse plunged and bucked, the Indian had moved from the front to the side. Grasping the high pommel of the saddle, he swung himself into it. He ignored teh swinging stirrups, holding on by gripping with his knees." (p 43) [Relationship with horse]

* "The selection of plastic figures there was good. There was one whole box of mixed cowboys and Indians. Omri searched till he found a chief wearing a cloak and a full feather headdress, with a bow in his hand and a quiverful of arrows slung across his back. Omri brought it with part of his lunch money and rushed back to school before he could be missed." (p. 65) [Plastic Figures]

* "'Little Bear isn't a toy. He's a real man. He really lived. Maybe he's still - I don't know - he's in the middle of his life - somewhere in America in seventeen-something-or-other. He's from the *past*,' Omri struggled to explain as Patrick looked blank." (p. 86) [Plastic Figures, Real, Live]

* "Meanwhile he was scraping the dry beans off the plate with his nails. He took the fragment of firelighter and the twigs out of his pocket and arranged them in the center of the plate. He washed the bit of meat in his bedside water glass. He'd had a wonderful idea for a spit to cook it on. From a flat box in which his first Erector set had once been neatly laid out, but which was now in chaos, he took a rod, ready bent into a handle shape, and pushed this through the meat. Then, from small bits of the set, he quickly made a sort of stand for it to rest on, with legs each side of the fire so that the meat hung over the middle of it." (p 91) [Adventures]

* "'You no Great Spirit! Only stupid boy! Fight, spoil good meal! You feel shame!'" (p. 94) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "'Peace of Great Spirits be with you'" (p. 111) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "The cowboy looked at it, looked up at. Omri, then, stood up and put the hat on. 'You shore ain't no reg'lar hallucy-nation,' he said. 'I'm obliged to ya.' Suddenly he laughed. 'Jest imagine, thankin' a piece o'yer dee-lirium tremens fer givin' you yer hat back! Ah jest cain't figger out what's goin' on around here. Say! Are you real, or was that Injun real? 'Cause in case you ain't noticed, you're a daned sight bigger'n he is. You cain't both be real.'" (p. 119) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Omri ate his cereal in silence, grinning to himself, hugging his secret. He slipped a couple of cornflakes into his pockets." (p. 133) [Omri's innocence, childlike eating]

* "Little Bear and Omri watched. From the microscopic point of Boone's pencil there developed a most amazing scene. It was a prairie landscape, with ills and cacti and a few tufts of sagebrush. Boone sketched in, with sure strokes, some wooden buildings such as Omri had often seen in cowboy films - a saloon with a swinging sign reading 'Golden Dollar Saloon' in twirly writing; a post office and general store, a lively stable, and a stone house with a barred window and a sing saying 'Jail.' Then, moving swiftly on his knees, as it were from one end of his 'street' to another, Boone drew in the foreground - figures of men and women, wagons, horses, dogs, and all the trappings of a little town." (p. 163) [Omri's engagement with Boone, Little Bear, drawing, Western]
