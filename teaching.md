### I have started reading children's books, and developing outlines for critically reading them. I do not have a teaching degree, but with an interest in teaching, I work on critically thinking about how to teach critical reading of children's books to little ones. I hope to share outlines below. ###

The top three books for children I have read are "The River", "Hatchet", and "Where the Wild Fern Grows".

Additional books include "Mandy", "The Indian in the Cupboard", "Mr. Popper's Penguins", "Island of the Blue Dolphins", "The Secret of the Indian", "Brian's Winter", "The Return of the Indian", "My Side of the Mountain", "The Call of the Wild", "On the Far Side of the Mountain", and "Out of the Dust".

Other children's books authors of interest include Thornton Burgess and Laura Ingalls Wilder, and "Brian's Return", "Brian's Hunt".

Children's books on a list include: "Chasing Vermeer", "A Dog's Life", "Elijah of Buxton", "Freak the Mighty", "George", "Gregor the Overlander", "Missing May", "My Brother Sam is Dead", "A Night Divided", "Rules", "Save Me a Seat", "A Snicker of Magic", "Esperanza Rising", and "Witness".

## Frightful's Mountain by Jean Craighead George ##
### Author ###
* "In 1986, I met Jean Craighead George at a friend's home in the upstate New York town were we all live. I grew up admiring the Craigheads, a fmily of naturalists, whose adventures I followed in *National Geographic* magazine, where they always seemed to be attaching transmitters to girzzly bears, banding bald eagles, or paddling canoes and fiberglass kayaks on first descents down the best western white waters. Always, there were flocks of children participating in every adventure and experiment. I thought the Craigheads might be the only family in America that was having more fun than the Kennedys. Obsessed with falcons as I was from birth, I read *My Side of the Mountain* in 1964. When I met Jean Craighead George that day in New York, she reminded me about the letter that I had written her"

* "trap fifty hawks: peregrines, Cooper's hawks, sharp-shins, red-tails, goshawks, merlins, and golden eagles"

* "lifelong devotion to raptors" and "natural history"

* "The knowledge and experience I acquired from falconers have marked my life and made me a far more effective advocate on nature's behalf. I have to assume that thousands of other children outside my immediate circle were also inspired to varying degrees of ecological stewardship by their exposure to Sam Gribley's adventures in *My Side of the Mountain*. It's my hope that this wonderful sequel, *Frightful's Mountain*, will inspire thousands of new kids."

### Who? ###
* Frightful, the peregrine falcon, quiet like daytime birds, whistling, wind music, images of strange woods and unknown to flowers, foreign sound, soft song of wind humming through the hemlock needles of home
* Sam Gribley, and his relationship with the falcon

### Where? ###
* Nature
* The Sky, winds
* the Mountain
* "forest clearing edged with bushes were song sparrows and cardinals lived"

### What? ###
* Sam lifted the falcon from the nest on the cliff, and she jabbed him
* Sam names her "Frightful", and says, that she is "a raving beuaty" and a "gigantic hemlock tree on the mountain"
* He nurtured her like a peregrine falcon mother would
* He made a perch for her
* Hunting, memory
* Frightful loved the sky
* wind, feathers
* relationship to engineering, trucks, industry
* bells tinkling along with the Falcons

* "I call her name in her own language; I whistle three notes - low, high, low. She responds by lifting the feathers on her body, then shaking them. This is called rousing, whic is feather talk meaning, 'I like you' I can't speak in feathers so I answer by imitating her love notes. I do this by pulling air through my two front teeth to make a soft, cozy sound."

* "He really is a falconer. Hack is an old falconry temr. Trainers put young unleashed birds who are just learning to fly and hunt on a hack board, a sort of artificial nest. They leave them there with food, just as the parents do at the nest. The youngsters, falconers say, are 'at hack' - free to fly and hunt. If they miss their prey they come back to the board to eat. After a juvenile makes its first kill, the falconers leash and train it. I guess Frightful's young would be put at hack, but nto jessed and leashed when they learned to hunt. Instead, they would fly on and live out their lives in the wild. I ask the officer if that is so." (p. 9, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "It had gorwn up in the open, probably when that side of the mountain was an Indian field, for its limbs grow horizontally to the groundm not up as they do when a white oak grows in a forest reaching for the sun.

The wildflowers can't push up, and when they don't grow, the soil erodes and is carried into the streams by the rain. The best thing to do, I told Alice, is to take different routes from place to place, or put a log across an old path and let it rest. I kick leaves onto her trail to protect it. Jessie Coon James walks up to me." (p. 55, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Bando has spread several of the topographical maps on his big oak table. The maps, which you order through the United States Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, are masterpieces of mapmaking. They reflect the shape of the Earth's surface, portrayed by countour lines twenty feet apart. These brown lines are the distinctive characteristic of topographic maps. They tell you exactly where and how high you are, so you can never get lost. They also show roads, buildings, railroads, transmission lines, mines and caves, vegetation, and towns, cities, rivers, lakes, canals, marshes, and waterfalls." (p. 73, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'You say she's going east by northeast?' he says taking out a compass with a housing that has 360 degrees marked on it, as well as a clear plastic base-late with straight sides that can be used as a ruler. It also has a directional, or pointer, arrow drawn on it. The compass is for orienteering - finding your way with a map - and saves you a lot of time plotting your course. You don't have to use a protractor to figure out the degrees." (p. 73, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Animals communicating with each other, and when you learn their language, you can communicatte with them too. Scientists as well as animal lovers do this." (p. 76, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The quadrangle maps, which are literally quadrangles, 16 3/4 by 22 3/4 inches, are not like the county maps. These are land not political boundaries. Their scale is three and three-quarter inches to the mile - a lot of space to put down the details. On the Delhi quadrangle map is Bando's cabin, my mountain. Mrs. Strawberry's house and farm, as well as all the buildings in Delhi. My millhouse and tree are not on it, for which I am grateful. I like privacy." (p. 77, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "On bare earth in the sun is another compass. This one is different from the first. Alice has propped up a stick at a 45-degree angle to the ground. On it hangs a stone on a string. Under it is a north-south directional stick. Smiling, I recall how Alice and I made a compass like this last spring. We placed a marker on the shadow that the hanging rock cast in the morning. Then, when the sun passed the meridian, we put another marker on the afternoon stone-shadow. Between the two marks and directly under the suspended rock, we laid a stick. We had a north-south line." (p. 92, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "There are no trails or roads up here, so, by lining up trees to keep us going in a straight line, and by reading the quadrangle maps to avoid cliffs and marshes, we strike off across the top of the mountain range. (p. 95, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

We traverse fields and forests, walk through barren lands where quails and woodcocks fly up at our feet, and, after twelve miles of bushwhacking, enter the Plattekill State Forest. We are greeted by a flock of wild turkeys, big, noisy, and glorious. They gobble and fly off, miraculously missing limbs and trunks as they zip through the forest. I could never hit one of those with my sling." (p. 95, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Map reading gives us a good excuse to rest." (p. 96, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "'There's a power line below us. It leads to the road at the bottom of Manorkill Falls. It'll be a lot easier to walk on the cleared land under those wires than in this dense forest." (p. 96, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "Bando is still bent over the maps. I cleeant he trout and wrap it in May-apple leaves, then dig a hole in the earth and build a fire. When the coals are hot, I push them into the hole, place the fish on them, and cover all with leaves, then soil." (p. 103, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "We find a log and sit down. A woodthrush sings. His song sounds like water spilling down the rocks in a cool, dark forest. As I listen, I thank Alice in spite of myself. Were it not for her, I would not be hearing that glorious song on top of this magnificent gore." (p. 104, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "The full moon is rising over the chimneys and gabled rooftops of the little town as I walk up the steps to the Ruffed Grouse Hotel and enter the lobby. At the registration desk I tap a bell and a tall man appears." (p. 109, On the Far Side of the Mountain)

* "and he stormed and ragged at them through the bars"
* "retaliated by teasing him"
* * "his anger waxed and waned"
* "the mor outrage to his dignity"
* "he accumulated a fund of wrath" (pp. 1-5, The Call of the Wild)

* "'Sacradam!' he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck, 'Dat one dam bully dog! Eh? How moch?'" (p. 7, The Call of the Wild)

* "He was friendly, in a treacherous sort of way, smiling into one's face the while he emditated some underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck's food at the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Francois's whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to Buck ut to recover the bone." (p. 7, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an itnent and silent circle. Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with whcih they were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them. This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneat the bristling mass of bodies." (p. 9, The Call of the Wild)

* "Francois made remarkable progress. Ere they returned to camp he kenw enough to stop at 'ho,' to go ahead at 'mush,' to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

'Tree vair' good dogs.' Francois told Perrault. 'Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt'ing.'" (p. 10, The Call of the Wild)

* "By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect: He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing: and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him aloe. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilt, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave's, was to be left alone, though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition." (p. 10, The Call of the Wild)

* "Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon. Buck was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still more surprisingly was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert, and active, anxious that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight." (p. 12, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was a hard day's run, up the canon, through Sheep Camp, past the Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep, and over the great Chilkoot Divide, which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fill the craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennet, where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring. Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled." (p. 12, The Call of the Wild)

* "Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces." (p. 13, The Call of the Wild)

* "And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him: In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest, and killed their meat as they ran it down. It was not task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness, and the cold, and dark." (p. 14, The Call of the Wild)

* "Close in under the shltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm was it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared." (p. 15, The Call of the Wild)

* "The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs int heir relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling. Francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always singing with the dogs, but it was of small avail." (p. 22, The Call of the Wild)

* "Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent, and kenw that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slpishod and slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a woman. 'Mercedes' the men called her. She was Charles's wife and Hal's sister - a nice family party." (p. 32, The Call of the Wild)

* "It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not moved druing the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the wildfowl driving up from the South in cunning wedges that split the air." (p. 39, The Call of the Wild)

* "He had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with ihs sister, or his arms, rather: while Buck was too near dead to be of fruther use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river." (p. 41, The Call of the Wild)

* "Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire, rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate an instnat, while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection." (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed." (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "He sat by John Thornton's fire, a broad-breasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting, tasting the savor of the meat" (p. 44, The Call of the Wild)

* "The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a thing that prayed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survive. Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertsed itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf." (p. 56, The Call of the Wild)

* "Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made. He stood up, listening and scenting. From far way driffted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew them as things heard in that toher world which persisted in his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before." (p. 61, The Call of the Wild)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "living the same day-to-day pattern he had started just after crash" (p. 5, Brian's Winter)

* "In truth he felt relieved when the food was gone. It had softened him, made him want more and more, and he could tell that he was moving mentally away from the woods, his situation. He started to think in terms of the city agian, of hamburgers and malts, and his dreams changed." (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "The plane, [crashing], [dream[ing] many times]" (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "But with the supplies from the plane his dreams changed back to food and when it was gone - in what seemed a very short time - a kidn of wanting, hunger returned that he ahd not felt since the first week. For a week or two he was in torment, never satisfied; even when he ahd plenty of  fish and rabbit or foolbird to eat he thought of the things he didn't have. It somehow was never enough and he seemed to be angry all the time, so angry that he wasted a whole day just slamming things around and swearing at his luck." (p. 6, Brian's Winter)

* "Almost a whiff, soemthing he could smell. He was hutning with the rifle when he sensed the change. He had awakened early, just before first light, and had decided to spend the entire day hunting and get maybe two or three foolbirds. He blew on the coals from the fire the night before until they glowed red, added some bits of dry grass, which burst into flame at once, and heated water in one of the aluminum pots that had come in the plane's survival pack." (p. 7, Brian's Winter)

* "A new coolness, a touch, a soft kiss on his cheek. It was the same air, the same sun, the same morning, but it was different, so changed that he stopped and raised his hand to his cheek and touched where the coolness had brushed him." (p. 7, Brian's Winter)

* "He closed his eyes and went to sleep like a baby." (p. 14, Brian's Winter)

* "He had made many friends - or at least acquaintances. Birds had taken on a special significance for him. At night the owls made their soft sounds, calling each other in almost ghostly hoonnes that scared him until he finally saw one call on a night when the moon was full and so bright it was almost like a cloudy day." (p. 15, Brian's Winter)

* "Before dawn, just as gray light began to filter through the trees, the day birds began to sing. They started slowly but before the gray had become light enough to see ten yards all the birds started to sing and Brian was brought out of sleep by what seemed to be thousands of singing birds." (p. 15, Brian's Winter)

* "Robins had an evening song and one they snag right before a rainstorm and another when the rain was done. Blue jays spent all their time complaining and swearing but they also warned him when something - anything was moving in the wods. Ravens and crows were the same - scrawking and cawing their way through the trees." (p. 16, Brian's Winter)

* "Good, he thought, I own something now. I belong. And he ahd gone on with his life believing that he wolves and he had settled everything." (p. 17, Brian's Winter)

* "Everything in nature means something and he had missed the warnings that summer was ending, had in many ways already ended, and what was coming would be the most dangerous thing he had faced since the plane crash." (p. 21, Brian's Winter)

* "And the sky over the lake was different as well. The soft, summer clouds were gone and where it was blue it was a flat coppery blue and where the clouds were coming they were a slate gray - and they grew as he watched. Not in thuderheads as in the summer, towering and full of drama, but an almost ugly gray that was all one shade, and expanded from the north to cover the sky as if pushed by a large hand. Even as he watched, the patch of blue he had seen at first was gone and all the sky was gray and he could smell rain. Again, not the rain of summer but a cooler, almost cold rain was coming and it made him shiver though it had not started yet." (pp. 24-25, Brian's Winter)

* "Those people were the pros, he thought - the Native Americans who had made the points centuries before. They lived all the time as Brian was trying to live now and they had experimented for thousands of years to come up with the designs of the heads. Brian closed his eyes and tried to remember how they had looked." (p. 27, Brian's Winter)

* "He searched his memory, what he had learned in school, seen on television, read in books, and nowhere could he find a picture of anybody saying how stone arrowheads were made." (p. 27, Brian's Winter)

* "Thigns never happened as he planned, however, and because he was concentrating on looking for rabbits he very nearly stepped on a foolbird. It blew up under his foot in a flash of leaves and feathers like a grenade detonating and flew off at a quartering angle away and to Brian's left front." (p. 29, Brian's Winter)

* "flock of geese" (p. 35, Brian's Winter)

* "It was not finished as well as the ancients ahd finished theirs, but it was sharp and tapered the right way and had a notch for tying it onto the shaft." (p. 39, Brian's Winter)

* "They must have been the wolves that had sung the night before just as he went to sleep. They had hunted well and he smiled, thinking how they must feel - how he felt when it went well - and turned to go to his stump, when he thought again." (p. 45, Brian's Winter)

* "Rabbits were easy to skin - the hide almost fell off them. The doe's skin was stuck tight to the meat and did not come off with simply pullying at it, the way a rabbit skin did. Brian had to use the tip of the knife to cut the skin away form the flesh, peeling it back a quarter of an inch at a time, and it took him the better part of an hour, working constantly, to get the hide loose, cutting it off the front legs and up the neck to the back of the head." (p. 47, Brian's Winter)

* "The entire world was white, bright white with new morning sun glaring off and through it and so intense that it made his temples hurt." (p. 71, Brian's Winter)
* "Snow had fallen in the night. Soft, large flakes, nearly four inches deep everywhere. On limbs, logs, the ground, on the lake ice - all over, an even four inches." (p. 71, Brian's Winter)
* "He moved around, did his toilet - drawing a picture in the snow when he did - and was amazed how well the boots worked, kept his feet warm and comfortable. As he came close to the shelter he saw a mouse appear almost magically out of the snow, run across the surface for three feet and then dive under again." (p. 72, Brian's Winter)

* "Almost simultaneously he saw different tracks in the snow in front of him. Big tracks. Huge tracks. The hair went up on his neck. They were big enough for bear and what he really didn't want to do in his whole life was meat a bear in thick brush, especially if it was a bear that had a memory of a bad night with a skunk." (p. 75, Brian's Winter)

* "Bright opened his eyes slowly, closed them against the brightness and the pain in his forehead, then opened them again." (p. 80, Brian's Winter)

* "He made a fire inside the shelter with coals from the outside fire and soon it was warm and toasty. He hung the rabbit-skin shirt up to dry and lay back to wait the rain out. Having worked all night the previous night and slept most of the day, he wasn't sleepy and thought that the rain seemed light and would probably end by daylight and when he finaly dozed off, warm and snug in the shelter, it seemed to be coming down more lightly all the time." (p. 87, Brian's Winter)

* "He needed wood and he spent most of that day dragging in dead poplar, finally taking the parka off because it was so heavy and working in the rabbit-skin shirt alone. Everything had ice frozen on it but it chipped off easily with the hatchet. When he had a good stack - enough for another week (he was definitly gun-shy now about storms) - he chopped some meat off one of the back legs of the moose for stew and settled in for another night of rubbing the hide of his parka to soften it." (p. 90, Brian's Winter)

* "The berries boiled first and he added snow water to them and kept them boiling until he had a kind of mush in the pan. By that time the meat had cooked and he set it off to the side and tasted the berry mush." (p. 94, Brian's Winter)

* "All that, he thought, all that and more to be thankful for and he ended the prayer - as it had seemed to become - with another thought about the pilot down in the lake, how he hoped the pilot had had a good life and was where it was good for him now." (p. 96, Brian's Winter)

* "Then he ate, quietly, thinking of his mother and father, and when he finished his Thanksgiving it was dark, pitch-dark, and he crawled into his bag to sleep and had just closed his eyes and started to get drowsy when he heard the gunshot." (p. 96, Brian's Winter)

* "He made a circle of the camp, walked out on the lake ice - which was covered with  snow as well - and back around and saw no tracks other than rabbit and mouse. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

Then he started to move toward where the sound had come from, workign slowly, amazed that he was starting to warm up and even feel comfortable. Back in the hood the air was kept from moving and his face grew warmer and the fact that his head was warm seemed to warm his whole body and once he became accustomed to the cold he could look around and appreciate the world around him. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

It was a world of beauty. It's like being inside glass, he thought, a beautiful glass crystal. The air was so clear he could see tiny twigs, needles on pine trees fifty, seventy-five yards away, and so still that when a chickadee flew from a tree to the meat piled near the entrace - where they flocked and picked at the meat - he could actually hear the rush of air as the bird flapped its wings." (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

* "But there was moisture in them, sap, and when it got very cold the sap must freeze. He went up to the tree that had just exploded and saw that a whole section seemed to have been blown out of the side - maybe a foot and a half long and four or five inches wide. Just shattered and blown apart and the force seemed to have come from inside the tree and he stood back and stared at the wound and thought on it and finally came up with a theory. (p. 99, Brian's Winter)

The tree would freeze on the outside first, a ring of frozen wood all the way around. Then, when it got truly cold - as it had last night - the inside would freeze." (p. 102, Brian's Winter)

* "He did not know how to make the rest of the snowshoe. He had seen pictures and kenw it had to be a web of some sort but could not visualize how to start. In the end he just started in the middle and worked to the ends, tying the strips of moose hide crosswise, fastened to each side, making horizontal strips about two inches apart, each strap pulled tight and tied off in a double knot." (p. 107, Brian's Winter)

* "Home was where he stopped to have a fire and by the end of a week - the warm weather held, rising to thirty above during the day - he actually stayed out away from the shelter for a night and sat by a fire in his clothes, listening to wolves howling, seeing a thousand diamond eyes from the firelight glittering in the snow around the fire pit." (pp. 119-120, Brian's Winter)

* A line // "Brian had discovered that there are almost no straight lines in nature. The sides of trees up and down, the horizon, far away, but very little else. Animal tracks almost always wandered, circled; seldom did they go straight for any distance." (p. 126, Brian's Winter)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "My brother Rabo was only a little boy half my age, which was twelve. He was small for one who had lived so many suns and moons, but quick as cricket. Also foolish, as a cricket when he was excited. For this reason and because I wanted him to help me gather roots and not go running off, I said nothing about the shell I saw or the gull with folded wings." (p. 1, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

"'The sea is not a stone without scratches,' I said. 'It is water and no waves.'" (p. 2, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "But Ramo's eyes missed little in the world. They were black like a lizard's and very large and, like the eyes of a lizard, could sometimes look sleepy." (p. 2, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "I kept on gathering roots, but my hands trembled as I dug in the earth, for I was more excited than my brother. I knew thatit was a ship there on the sea and not a big canoe, and that a ship could mean many things. I wanted to drop the stick and run too, but I went on digging roots because they were needed in the village." (p. 3, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "I was surprised that he gave his real name to a stranger. Everyone in our tribe had two names, the real one which was secret and was seldom used, and one which was common, for if people use your secret name it becomes worn out and loses its magic. Thus I was known as Won-a-pa-lei, which means The Girl with the Long Black Hair, though my secret name is Karnaa. My father's secret name was Chowig. Why he gave it to a stranger I do not know." (p. 5, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Everyone on the beach looked up. Silently I left the toyon bushes and ran without stoppiing until I reached the mesa." (p. 7, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Our island is two leagues long and one league wide, and if you were standing on one of the hills that rise int he middle of it, you would think that it looked like a fish. Like a dolphin lying on its side, with its tail pointing otward the sunrise, its nose pointing to the sunset, and its fins making reefs and the rocky ledges along the shore. Whether someone did stand there on the low hills in the days when the earth was new and, because of tis shape, called it the Island of the Blue Dolphins." (p. 8, Island of the Blue Dolphins) 
* "Many dolphins live in our seas and it may be from them that the name came." (p. 8, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Many of our tribe went to the cliff each night to count the number killed during the day. They counted the dead otter and thought of the beads and other things that each pelt meant. But I never went to the cove and whenever I saw the hunters with their long spears skimming over the water, I was angry, for these animals were my friends. It was fun to see them playing or sunning themselves among the kelp. It was mreo fun thant the htought of beads to wear around my neck." (p. 15, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "There are no trees on the island except the small ones stunted by the wind. When a log came ashore, as happened once in a long time, it was always carried to the village and worked on where a chance wave could not wash it away. That the men were sent to hollow out the log in the cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the Aleuts, to give the alarm should Captain Orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins." (p. 16, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

Since there were already ample food to last through the winter, it no longer mattered who hunted." (p. 26, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The wind blew in fierce gusts as we left the village, stinging our faces with sand. Rmao hopped along far in front with one of our baskets, but before long he ran back to say that he had forgotten his fishing spear. Nanko was standing on the cliff motioning us to hurry, so I refused to let him go back for it." (p. 35, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The sails had filed and the ship was now moving slowly away. Everyone was looking toward the cliff, even the white men. I ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. The ship began to move faster. Against my will, I screamed." (p. 37, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The wind blew storng as we climbed the trail, covering th mesa with sand that sifted around our legs and shut out th esky.

(p. 39, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "Fogs crept in and out of the empty huts. It amde shapes as it drifted and they reminded me of all the people who were dead and those who were gone. The noise of the surf seemed to be their voices speaking." (p. 47, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "the sun came out and the fog vanished" (p. 47, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "the canoes were hidden, believing that weapons might have been stored there with the food and water" (p. 49, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

I stood on the, bracing myself against the waves, so that I would not have to look for it again. When the tide turned I began to dig with my feet, working them down and down, and then with my hands." (p. 50, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

THey circled down to the tide pools where they stood first on one leg and then the other, splasing waterover themselves and combing their feathers with curved beaks.

I was very lonely before they appeared, but now I felt that I had friends with me and did not feel the same. (p. 63, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The blue dolphins left me shortly before dusk. They left as quickly as they had come, going on into the west, but for a long time I could see the last of the sun shining on them." (p. 63, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "a steadier flow of water" (p. 67, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "They follow their mothers around, waddling along on their flippers like children learning to walk, making crying sounds and sounds of pleasure tha tonly the young make. And before they will leave the shore and learn to swim, thei rmothers have to push them into the sea, which is often difficult to do because of their size." (p. 77,  Island of the Blue Dolphins)

The dunes were covered with mats of sand flowers, which are red and have tiny eyes that are sometimes pink and sometimes white. Yuccas grew tall among the rocks of the ravine.

From the sunny cliffs, in crevices where no one would think anything could grow, sprang the little read and yellow fountains of the comul bush." (p. 108, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

Red-winged blackbirds also came flying out of the south, and flocks of crows, and a bird with a yellow body and a scarlet head, which I had never seen before." (pp. 108-109, Island of the Blue Dolphin)

* "The pull suddenly lessened and I was sure that he was gone, but the next instant I saw the string cutting the water in a wide circle.

(p. 117, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

* "The sun made bright scales on the water, but I could see clearly. There were two sails and it was a ship coming toward the island. For a long time I could not tell the color fo the sails.

* "The sea water kept the abalones fresh, but when we had to go out again the night was took dark to find our way to the reef. I therefore had to gather roots. I could never gather many before the sun rose, so I went tou every monring until the next moon came. Then I went to the reef for abalones." (p. 129, Island of the Blue Dolphins)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
"At moments like this, he would remember Little Bear. Little Bear had been only a fraction of Omi's size, and yet he had stood up to him. If he had felt scared, as Omri did now, he never showed it. Omri was not that much smaller than these boys. There were just so many of them, and only one of him. But imagine if they'd been giants, as he was to Little Bear. They were nothing but kids like himself, although several years older. Except that they weren't like 'Pigs. Toads. Mad dogs.' It would be shameful to let them see he was afraid of them. He gripped his schoolba tightly by both handles and came on." (p. 3, The Return of the Indian)

* "An experience lik that taught you something. He fled, hating himself but hating his enemies worse. They didn't pursue him. That would have been too much trouble. But their shouts and jeers followed him all the way to his gate." (p. 5, The Return of the Indian)

* "They chatted on rather awkwardly, with some silences, but it got better. By the time they'd reached the station it was almost as if Patrick ahd never gone away, as if they were still as close as they used to be. That was why Omri didn't hesitate to say, 'Where do you keep Boone and his horse?'" (p. 7, The Return of the Indian)

* "It's lonely having a secret like that. If Patrick hand'tmoved away, if they could have kept talking about it and remembering together, then he'd never have denie it, or started trying to pretend it never happened." (p. 8, The Return of the Indian)

* "communed with her, eyeball to eyeball" (p. 10, The Return of the Indian)

* "In the old house, his bedroom had been just one of several opening off the upstairs landing, and at certain times of the day had been like a railway station. His new room was off the beaten track. No one (in his opinion) had any reason to come up here, or even pass the door. There were times, now that he had it all arranged to suit himself, when he forgot about how awful it was living in Hovel Road, when it seemed wroth anything to have a room like this." 9p. 17, The Return of the Indian)

* "Put any plastic object - an ax, an India tepee, a quiver of arrows - into it, close the door, turn the key... and those things became real - miniature but real. Real leather, real cloth, real steel. Put the plastic figures of human beings or animals inside, and in the time it took to lock them in, they, too, became real. Real and live. And not just 'living toys', but people from another time, from their own lives, with their own personalities and needs and demands." (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)
* "Cabinet's magic properties" (p. 20, The Return of the Indian)

* "By putting their plastic figures into the magic cupboard, by turning the magic key, Omri had the power to recall them to life. To youth. He could snatch them from the past. The whole business nearly blew Omri's mind every time he thought at all deeply about it. So he tried not to think about it too much. And to prevent his yielding to temptaiton, he had given his mother the key. She wore it around her neck on a chain (it was quite decorative). People often asked her about it, and she would say, 'It's Omri's really, but he lends it to me.' That wasn't the whole truth. Omri had pressed it on her and begged her to keep it safe for him. Safe...not just getting lost again, but safe from him, from his longing to use it again; to reactivate the magic, to bring back his friends. To bring back the time when he had been - not happiest, but most intensely, dangerously alive himself." (pp. 22-23, The Return of the Indian)

* "His story was original. Adiel had relieved his mind up, if you had the experience, and you wrote about it, it was original. So he hadn't cheated. But the story wasn't only his. It also belonged to the little men - to Little Bear, and Boone, and even to Tommy, the World War I soldier. (It belonged to Patrick, too, but if Patrick had decided to deny it ever happened, then he'd given up his rights in it.)" (p. 28, The Return of the Indian)

* "Omri knew how bitter the hatred between warring tribes could be. The Algonquins, for instance, were the Iroquois's mortal enemies - it would be no use bringing any of them. But since there weren't anything like enough that he was sure were Iroquois. Omri had brough some others he wasn't sure of, in the home that Little Bear would recognize them as belonging to some friendly Indian nation who would agree to help the Iroquois in their hour of trial." (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* English soldiers; differing periods; the French in America; Omri, "keen on brining any white men into it' (p. 97, The Return of the Indian)

* "She put the glove-finger around him tot he armpits while Boone ran up the ramp and puled it up behind him. The two ponies were munching grass in their frenced-off paddock. Omri picked the whole thing up, while Patrick took the cupboard and the bag of new men. As an afterhtought he slipped Matron in his pocket. Omri did a quick reconnaissance to see that nobody was around. The they cautiously trooped down the stairs and out the kitchen door into the back garden.

It was really a lovely place, far better than their old garden. It was not just a rectangle of lawn with a few flower beds. It had nooks and crannies. Omri headed for his favorite corner, a clump of bushes with a patch of grass in the middle, where rhododendrons and other tall plants kept prying eyes at bay. The sun was high and the place was sheltered from the wind. Still, Omri suggested Little Bear should be put into the longhouse to keep warm." (p. 100, The Return of the Indian)

His home, his life - all the solid things. Divorce. A breaking word, an ugly breaking word. Divorce. Secrets." [Divorce] (pp. 2-3)

* "pain come and go in waves" [Description of Pain] (p. 34)


* "Everything was green, so green it went into him. The forest was largely made up of pines and spruce, with stands of some low brush smeared here and there and thick grass and some other kind of very small brush all over. He couldn't identify most of it - except the evergreens - and some leafy trees he thought might be aspen. He'd seen pictures of aspens in the mountains on tele-vision. The country around the lake was moderately hilly, but the hills were small - almost hummocks - and there were very few rocks except to his left.

Shining black and silky the bear stood on its hind legs, half up, and studied Brian, just studied him, then lowered itself and moved slowly to the left, eating berries as it rolled along, wuffling and delicately using its mouth to lift each berry from the stem, and in seconds it was gone. Gone, and Brian still had not moved. His tongue was stuck to the top of his mouth, the tip half out, his eyes were wide and his hands were reaching for a berry." [Experience with Nature] (p. 70)
* "Then he made a sound, a low: 'Nnnnnnggg.' It made no sense, was just a sound of fear, of disbelief" [Sound] (p. 70)

* "He smiled. City boy, he thought. Oh, you city boy with your city ways - he made a mirror in his mind, a mirror of himself, and saw how he must look. City boy with your city ways sitting in the sand trying to read the tracks and not knowing, not understanding. Why would anything wild come up from the water to play in the sand? Not that way, animals weren't that way. They didn't waste time that way." [City Boy] (p. 93)


* "Mistakes. Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death. In the city if he made a mistake usually there was a way to rectify it, make it all right. If he fell on his bike and sprained a leg he could wait for it to heal; if he forgot something at the store he could find other food in the refrigerator." [Mistakes, Disasters] (p. 121)
* "Mistakes. He tried to learn from the mistakes. He couldn't bury food again, couldn't leave it in the shelter, because something like a bear could get at it right away. It had to be high, somehow, high and safe." [Mistakes, Learning] (pp. 125-126)


* "The days ahd folded one into another and mixed so that after two or three weeks he only knew time had passed in days because he made a mark for each day in stone near the door to his shelter. Real time he measured in events. A day was nothing, not a thing to remember - it was just sun coming up, sun going down, some light in the middle." [Days Folding Into One Another] (p. 129)

* "the birds could fly amazingly fast, get up fast" [Birds Flying] (p. 134)


* "Pushing the raft, he figured, was about like trying to push an aircraft carrier. All the branches that stuck down into the water dragged and pulled and the logs themselves fought any forward motion and he hadn't gone twenty feet when he realized that it was going to be much harder than he thought to get the raft to the plane. It barely moved and if he kept going this way he would just about reach the plane at dark. He decided to turn back again, spend the night and start early in the morning, and pulled the raft once more onto the sand and wide-scraped it dry with his hand." [The Raft, Experience] (p. 157)

### Interesting Sentences or Paragraphs ###
* "If the Indian *were* real, and not just - well, moving plastic, as Pinocchio had been moving wood, then he would need food and other things. And Omri had left him shut up in the dark all day with nothing. Perhaps - what if there were not enough air for him in that cupboard? The door fitted very tight. How much air would such a very small creature need? What if - what if the Indian were - what if he'd *died*, shut up there? What if Omri had killed him?" (pp. 18-19) [Interaction with the Indian, Imagination]

* "Biscuits, jam, peanut butter, that sort of thing was no problem, but somehow Omri felt sure these were not Indian foods. Suddenly his searching eyes fell on an open tin of sweet corn. He found a paper plat in the drawer where the picnic stuff lived, and took a good teaspoonful of corn. Then he broke off a crusty corner of bread. Then he thought of some cheese. And what about a drink? Milk? Surely Indian braves did not drink milk? They usually drank something called 'firewater' in films, which was presumably a hot drink, and Omri dared not heat anything. Ordinary non-firewater would have to do, unless...What about some Coke? That was an American drink. Lucky there was a bit in a big bottle left over from his birthday, so he took that. He did wish there was some cold meat, but there just wasn't." (p. 23) [Foot, Descriptions]

* "'Not want toy,' said the Indian" (p. 28) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Little Bear not lie. Great hunter. Great fighter.'" (p. 38) [The Way the Indian Talks]
* "'Some. French. Not take English scalps. Englishmenf riends to Iroquois. Help Indian fight Algonquin enemy.'" (p. 37) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Down in the kitchen he ransacked his mother's store cupboard for a tin of meat. He found some corned beef at last and opened it with the tin opener on the wall." (p. 39) [Ransacked]

* "In a moment he had vaulted over the bottom edge of the cupboard and, as the horse reared in fright, jumped into the air under its flying hooves and grasped the leather reins. The horse fought to free its head, but Little Bear hung on with both hands. Even as the horse plunged and bucked, the Indian had moved from the front to the side. Grasping the high pommel of the saddle, he swung himself into it. He ignored teh swinging stirrups, holding on by gripping with his knees." (p 43) [Relationship with horse]

* "The selection of plastic figures there was good. There was one whole box of mixed cowboys and Indians. Omri searched till he found a chief wearing a cloak and a full feather headdress, with a bow in his hand and a quiverful of arrows slung across his back. Omri brought it with part of his lunch money and rushed back to school before he could be missed." (p. 65) [Plastic Figures]

* "'Little Bear isn't a toy. He's a real man. He really lived. Maybe he's still - I don't know - he's in the middle of his life - somewhere in America in seventeen-something-or-other. He's from the *past*,' Omri struggled to explain as Patrick looked blank." (p. 86) [Plastic Figures, Real, Live]

* "Meanwhile he was scraping the dry beans off the plate with his nails. He took the fragment of firelighter and the twigs out of his pocket and arranged them in the center of the plate. He washed the bit of meat in his bedside water glass. He'd had a wonderful idea for a spit to cook it on. From a flat box in which his first Erector set had once been neatly laid out, but which was now in chaos, he took a rod, ready bent into a handle shape, and pushed this through the meat. Then, from small bits of the set, he quickly made a sort of stand for it to rest on, with legs each side of the fire so that the meat hung over the middle of it." (p 91) [Adventures]

* "'You no Great Spirit! Only stupid boy! Fight, spoil good meal! You feel shame!'" (p. 94) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "'Peace of Great Spirits be with you'" (p. 111) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "The cowboy looked at it, looked up at. Omri, then, stood up and put the hat on. 'You shore ain't no reg'lar hallucy-nation,' he said. 'I'm obliged to ya.' Suddenly he laughed. 'Jest imagine, thankin' a piece o'yer dee-lirium tremens fer givin' you yer hat back! Ah jest cain't figger out what's goin' on around here. Say! Are you real, or was that Injun real? 'Cause in case you ain't noticed, you're a daned sight bigger'n he is. You cain't both be real.'" (p. 119) [The Way the Indian Talks]

* "Omri ate his cereal in silence, grinning to himself, hugging his secret. He slipped a couple of cornflakes into his pockets." (p. 133) [Omri's innocence, childlike eating]

* "Little Bear and Omri watched. From the microscopic point of Boone's pencil there developed a most amazing scene. It was a prairie landscape, with ills and cacti and a few tufts of sagebrush. Boone sketched in, with sure strokes, some wooden buildings such as Omri had often seen in cowboy films - a saloon with a swinging sign reading 'Golden Dollar Saloon' in twirly writing; a post office and general store, a lively stable, and a stone house with a barred window and a sing saying 'Jail.' Then, moving swiftly on his knees, as it were from one end of his 'street' to another, Boone drew in the foreground - figures of men and women, wagons, horses, dogs, and all the trappings of a little town." (p. 163) [Omri's engagement with Boone, Little Bear, drawing, Western]
