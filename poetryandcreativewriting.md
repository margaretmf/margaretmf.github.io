## I was grateful in high school for an English teacher in high school who taught creative writing, and I was grateful for another English teacher in high school who taught the American Credo Project. I did not particularly enjoy creative writing, but I love that creative writing supports people who have experienced "moral hangovers" or have been imprisoned.** I used to experience mental breakdowns, not say enough, or say or write too much, sometimes out of anger, so I have turned to writing poetry to work through feelings. Some people have discovered that The Psalmist is the best therapist, so I am trying out myown poetry. ##

## People encourage engineers to write poetry as well. In engineering, people write snippets of code, structure code logically and creatively, and think in and about systems. In poetry, people write snippets of words, and learn to structure words and code creatively and logically." ##

## There is some other writing at the bottom. ##

# Beliefs #
## Art ##
*I believe* participation in the fine arts brings joy [in 2009, 2010]
 
*Do I still believe this?*
I believe and have found that playing music and participating in improv brings joy. I also enjoy learning to paint, apprecating others' music, and appreciating others' paintings. [2021]

## Nature ##
*I believe* nature allows a simpler and fuller life [in 2009, 2010]

*Do I still believe this?*
I find nature to be calming, and refreshing. I particulary enjoyed nature in Charlottesville while rowing, the farmland in Georgia, and the country and rivers in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. [2021]

I also believe that the land belongs to everyone, and that we all share the same ancestry, rooted in God. [2021]

## Spirituality ##
*I believe* "God is all and God is good" [in 2009, 2010]

*Do I still believe this?* 
I have found evidence that God is always leading me to what I need to know, and is always somehow connecting more deeply to something true about myself or others.
I have found that I can see God's expression everyone through compassion, intelligence, joy, peace.
I have also found God to be at my right hand in situations, voicing the Truth, and uplifting with the right ideas.

## Individual/Society ##
*I believe* "each individual is a link in the chain - if that link fell, the chain would break." [in 2009, 2010]
 
*Do I still believe this?*
I do not know, but I love this concept, and I have felt reminded of this intuitively.
I love learning about interconnectedness, and how we are all connecting each other to a higher sense of life.
I also love learning about distinctions, distinct ideas, and how everyone is individual and distinct.
Christian Science teaches that "we are all tributary to the same source", but there are distinct differences between everyone in good ways. [2021]

# Creative Writing #
## Journey Writing ##
## Do you have a tattoo? What is it and why did you get it? If not, would you ever get one? What would the tattoo be, and what would it symbolize to you? ##
No. I think that tattoos look good on people and that people with tattoos break cultural traditions. I do not want to get a tattoo just to buy into a trend that others are buying into. If I were to get a tattoo to break free from traditional value systems, I would not get a tattoo.

## Write about someone you aspire to be like. ##
President Barack Obama is a figure I look up to. When facing adversity, he exudes great qualities. He does not seek fame. He did not seek to live and work in the noble office. He does not bicker and complain when facing criticism, attacks, and name-calling. He does not seek to be a prima donna. I aspire to be like him. I seek to express humility, patience, confidence, love, meekness, and graciousness. I hope to treat everyone in the nation as he treats people, and appreciate the interdependencies in human relationships throughout the land. Everyone has a voice, a right to sing, a right to express, a right to love nature, and a right to truly live and learn and heal. I seemed abusive and monstrous when sending images of guns? Would someone in a celebrity photo with the President send guns? Would someone in a celebrity photo with the President gossip, attack, complain, and cry? No, and no.

## How do you soothe yourself when you are upset? ##
When upset, I soothe myself through telling myself that it's ok to cry. I feel pain when I make mistakes. People make mistakes. It is ok. I will see beauty another day. I will survive another day. It's ok to not want to live. I will progress and expand and live life more to the fullest, however. I love the joy that comes from looking someone in the eye, giving them full attention and appreciation, and listening to understand.

## Does writing change you? How does writing make you a better person? ##
Writing changes me. Writing, a tool for expressing thoughts, feelings, experiences in words, helps to articulate and process the inner and outer worlds. Using the right words, forming the right sentence structure exercises the process of sharing what goes on within and around through speech. Writing transforms my thinking and helps me better connect to people.

## What bad habit would you like to change? ##
I would love to *stop* looking people up on Instagram and Google. I would love to stop sending hostile emails. Through loving the glory of a new day, the beauty in a smile, and the lessons taught in computer class, I will break the habit. Through writing down thoughts on Github, and in journals, and working with my hands, I will break the pattern, and the habit.

## What keeps you from getting a good night's sleep? ##
Ruminating over the past, the things done wrong, and the missed connections keeps me from getting a good night's sleep. There have been many nights when mortal, scary dreams and anxiety about the future or the things done wrong have prevented me from sleeping. I turn my thought to setting the right desires, loving God, and resting in the consciousness of God's provisions.

## Write about a time you broke something. ##
Once, I was fighting within so much that I broke everything in my house. It was a continuation of what it was like as a child when kicking doors and windows. There's a loud fight within, and it leads me to break things. I am building back up now.

## What, in your opinion, is strength? ##
Strength is the courage withint o do what's right. Strength is the peace within to forgive and not react. Strength is the ability to accomplish tasks. Strength is the expression of love.

## What has made you angry this week? ##
All of the emphasis on self, comparing, and competing made me feel angry. Feeling rejected, teased, and mocked made me feel inferior. It feels like none of my work never measures up. Other people look like opera divas whle people tell me I have seemed high maintenance, like an opera diva when I can't fully express myself, and like I have a fragile ego underneath.

## Struggling vs. Suffering ##
Struggling - fighting the good fight, persisting in the face of adversity, committing to the team, listening to mentors, working through the suffering, overcoming evil suggestions and beliefs with good, gratitude, helpfulness, and saying no to the "tempter" when wanting to do what seems wrong but desiring to do what's right.

Suffering - pain silence with no ability while feeling like one can't speak up, one can't be heard, one can't be understood, always on the outside looking in, and like someone is being a mouthpiece for one's thoughts, feeling guilt and shame and guilt and shame, and endless ties to people who do not care.

Pain - empathizing with the needs with someone else, feeling the inflicted harm of someone, feeling the negative energy from another's heart.

## When was the last time you pulled an all-nighter? Why did you do it? How did you feel afterwards? ##
The last time I remember pulling an all-nighter was seven years ago. I worked through the night in the bottom of the library. Other students I could see studying in there. Doing the work was the last thing I wanted to do, but I pushed myself with eyes feeling heavy, and me becoming a zombie. Then I remember walking back to the dorm really early in the morning with the dark sky.

## Write about a memory you associate with the color blue. ##
Associated with the color blue, I have memories of my cousin playing soccer at the ocean front, and being my friend at the beach cottage. I remember blue pipes on the ceiling at the beach cottage, and I remember hanging on them with my cousins Mary, and Kim, as well as Mary's friends.

## What, in your opinion, is strength? ##
Strength is the courage within to do what's right. Strength is the peace within to forgive and not react. Strength is the ability to accomplish tasks. Strength is the expression of love.

## Do you have any dreams that recur? Why do you think you continue to have that dream? ##
A recurring dream I have is the one of the imagery of The Mother Church coming to thought before Association. I am grateful for the purity of the Church Architecture, and the light shining through all the churches. I am grateful for healing across the land, and respect for all cultures besides my own.

## What crime or faux pas would you commit if you knew you would get away with it? ##
Don't worry. I have already committed a crime. I have committed a crime on social media that in the 21st century leads to divorce, cheating, and trouble. I have created fake, faux accounts, stalked people, and called people out. I have spread people's names, and hurt people with words. I must stop. The social media companies are doing with my account what they are doing with President Trump's. If I get away with it, great - it's mortal mind. I must stop the crime.

## List 25 things you will never do. ##
(1) I will never carry a gun.
(2) I will never shoot a gun.
(3) I will never engage in a sexual relationship before marriage.
(4) I will never intrude on someone's home in another state.
(5) I will never aim to be a celebrity.
(6) I will never attempt to commit suicide again.
(7) I will never sell anything to my uncles.
(8) I will never criticize an interracial marriage.
(9) I will never do a PhD...I don't think I will...but never say never...because I might actually do it...
(10) I will never step in front of someone else in line.
(11) I will never mention someone else in an email again.
I can't think of 25, so this is the list of 10.

## You are on the cover of a magazine. What are you famous for? ##
I don't care to be on the cover of a magazine. I don't enjoy taking a lot of selfies. I have no desire to be on the cover or front-and-center. I love working with a team and collaborating on projects. If I were on the cover of a magazine, I'd love to be with a team addressing a challenge collectively.

## Complete this thought: 'Today I hope...' ##
Today I hope to clean my room, do business work, go to Nate's house.
Today I hope to live with love.
Today I hope not to use social media.
Today I hope to take a shower.
Today I hope to uplift my thought for humanity.
Today I hope to live in peace.
Today I hope to pray the prayers we prayed in school for all schools nationwide.
Today I hope someone feels free of a claim that holds them in hostage and in bondage.

## Memories ##
I remember the crowd of people wearing red, white, and blue clothes.
I remember the women working on grassroots projects in the Stadium.
I remember the reformation, and the repentance, and the shift of view.
I remember the size of the crowd.
I remember my friend's passion.
I remember the people working in the post office, and the Fed Ex Office, and the Government buildings, and the Salvation Army.
I remember listening to "One Tribe" and "I Believe".
I remember serving in the Diversity and Inclusion Club and God giving me an interest in Islam in high school. I remember feeling "white privilege" and "white guilt" in the Diversity and Inclusion Club.
I remember taking a photo.
I remember feeling concerned about healing from racial prejudices.
I remember praying with the prayers of African American mothers for the African Americans and then an African American man telling me I would be a good mom.
I remember questioning if I was a lesbian or not and actually imagining if I was a lesbian, transgender, and someone asked me if I was a lesbian.

## What is a memory you would like to erase? ##
As a free agent, I would like to erase the memory of being 'a heartbroken cowgirl', a criminal, and a damsel in distress within. I am a free agent, I am able, I am intelligent, I have a good sense of humor, and I am quick to forgive.

## In what way are you selfish? ##
I can be a selfish person. When I dwell in self-pity, and complain about rejection, the slights, the things done wrong, the ways others are perfect, and I am not. I am selfish when I use the word 'I' in every sentence and harass people. I am selfless when I do the right thing, see the needs of a neighbor, put in the extra work for no gain, and provide to people. 

## Write about a good discovery you have made (big or small). ##
The biggest discovery I have made over the past year and in this life is that African Americans are life-giving. They have deep faith, they live poetically, they are strong, and they are overcomers. They inspire me to let go of prejudices and live another day for the higher good set before mankind.

## What modern technological device takes up most of your time? ##
Instagram takes up most of my time. I see all the photos of someone grabbing my attention. She looks like the perfect, ideal Southern woman, and virgin. She looks like the able, cofident, free, and singing woman. This appears as everything I am not. I have actually let it eat up my time, and devour my heart with anger, and violence. I also use this device to share my photography and sketches. Why do I need to put everything online? It eats up everything.

## What would you like to apolgoize to you, and for what? ##
I would like to apologize to a musician for expressing all of my heartache and heartbreak and violence over womanhood and relationships. I guess I seem entitled. I could not, can not apologize. There was never a response. All I felt was pulled to face my loudest triggers and insecurities.

## Write about something nice a stranger did for you. ##
Once, I lost my temper at Starbucks. I threw the coffee cup on the ground. I looked pathetic. I was a horrible person. One stranger pardoned me and prayed for me from her car. Another straner prayed with me near a tree to help me stay grounded in reality.

## Have you ever lived in another country besides your country of birth? Would you want to? ##
I have lived in Scotland, Ireland, and Argentina. I am grateful I rowed with the Scottish. I remember being alone in the dark and feeling lost when miraculously my Scottish rowing coach found me walking before practice. I love that I went to music concerts in Ireland. I am grateful for the readings and church services in Spanish in Argentina.

## Which is stronger, love or hate? ##
Hate seems to be strong. It seems to tear one's heart up and throw one's life into shambles. Unconditional love is the most powerful force in the world, however. It overcomes the strongest, most monstrous waves of hate. Unconditional love overcomes all through to the ends of the world.

## What do you think is the most important thing for today's kids to learn in school? ##
I think that the most important thing for today's kids to identify emotions, and develop healthy relationships with people that are different from them. I also think it is improtant for kids to learn how to manage money but not worship money. I believe in the next generation! :) :)

**Name** became a **type of career/success** because he was **trait**, **trait**, and **trait**.
"Colin Powel became an **inspiring leader** because he is **brave**, **intelligent**, and **ambitious**."
"Sandy Koufax was a **remarkable sports hero** because of his **work ethic**, **amazing athletic ability**, and **teamwork**."
"Because of his **determination**, **Martin Luther King Jr.** was able to overcome **educational barriers**, **prejudice**, and **violence** to become a **political leader** who changed America.

## For people who have made awful, horrible mistakes -- what questions would you ask them? ##
(1) How have you changed over the past 1 year - 5 years - 10 years?
(2) What have you learned in relationships?
(3) What challenges have you overcome?
(4) How have you rediscovered aspects of your true self?

## Periodically we have tension build up in our lives that requires a release of some kind. Some people cry, others punch, and some find a creative outlet. What is your release? ##
I have experienced heartbreak, and I had been listening to popular music in the music industry targeting heartbreaking females. It felt comforting on the one hand to listen to the music, but on the other hand I didn't know how the music would fully heal heartbreak, or an emotional wound. As soon as the musician posted photos of his girlfriend, with a guitar, looking like a strong woman to make it worse, in NOLA, where my grandmother was from, so much tension came to the surface. I didn't want to cry. I kicked a door, and threw my cowboy boots in the trash can, and I became a criminal online. I yelled out, and ultimately I learned to give my tears to God.

## What very dangerous thing would you do in a heartbeat if given the opportunity? ##
It's not a dangerous thing to do, but with a passion for music, in a heartbeat, I would work towards becoming a professional musician. I love playing music improv and composing music. I feel like I am becoming better. Also, in a heartbeat, I would take more painting classes.

## What is a personality trait you admire in other people? ##
I admire the quality of integrity the most in people. I think this means that one has to be true to oneself at heart, let God work through them intuitively, and strive to work ethically, morally, and compassionately. I admire thoughtfulness, and the quality of diving deeper into ideas once visited.

## Is our world today a better or worse place than it was when you were a kid? ##
I think our world is in a better place today. I think a lot has shifted, many lessons have been learned, and people are more mature, active, and expressive than when I was a kid. I think family relationship ties have grown deeper, harmony has increased, but everyone, mostly myself, has to watch for regressions.

## Do you like your name? Do you feel like it suits you? If you could change your name, would you? What would you change it to? ##
I love my name. My name is Margaret for a reason. I love that I am my grandmother's namesake. I feel that it suits me because we express similar qualities. I am intellectual, compassionate, and natural, and musical like my grandmother, Margaret. I love words, puzzles, and math like my grandmother also. 

I share the same name as Margaret Thatcher as well, and people have reminded me that I express much strength despite my follies and vices. I love that I am unique, individual, Margaret.

'Margaret' means 'daisy' in French, and flowers turn to the sun. Margaret in Sanskrit means 'pearl'. Pearls grow in oysters. Sometimes irritants come up, but the irritants grind against the 'pearl of great price' within.

My name is a Western-European name, and I love that people from other cultures share similar experiences with names being tied to meanings and ancestry.

If I were to go by another name, I would go by "Meg", but "Margaret" is amazing as well :)

## What is the last thing (or one of the last things you searched for on the Internet? ##
One of the last things I searched for on the Internet is the medieval music. I drew the connection between the cowboy culture and the knight culture. Love songs come into being from both cultures. People used to use the medieval organ to play love songs, "country" music, as well as church music. During the late medieval period, and the Scientific Revolution, people understood music through science.

## Write about a real or imagined train ride you have taken. ##
I have taken real train rides to Pennsylvania and back, and to Boston and back. I love looking out the windows, and seeing the scenery. People from different walks of life come on and come off the platform. I appreciate the hustle and the bustle in the train station. It's beautiful to imagine the dance of life in the situation, and on the train. What a wonderful experience it is to share affection with family members on and off the train.

## Write about a time you felt alone. ##
Alone, alone, alone, alone all the time I seemed like the epitome of a "damsel in distress". I made it very obvious to people that I was crying inside. I annoyed people. I held prejudices, and biases, and grievances, but I uncovered them; and I realized that I am never alone. People live all around me. I can be and am being a neighbor everyday in the neighborhoods, even the unsafe ones.

## If you could do one thing every day for the rest of your life, what would it be, and why? ##
For the rest of my life, if I could do something, I would take up the life of a naturalist.
I would observe and truly listen to nature.
I would take field notes.
I would write down 5 images, and 5 sounds every day.
I would talk to someone in person every day.
I would love family members, including distant family members, every day.
I would appreciate the study of history, a natural science.
I would appreciate the stories told in families, and people's ancestors, lineage, and heritage.
I would play music, take photography, and love more every day.

## What makes you smile or laugh every time you think of it? ##
Today, I randomly smiled at a stranger at Starbucks. She was so beautiful. She smiled right back. We recriprocated our love for one another. Our eyes met. We connected truly. I helped her. She helped me even more. I love how God puts a smile right on our faces even when we feel the need to cry, and break down. It's wonderful that God is always at work.

## What historical figure would you like to interview? What would you ask? ##
W. E. B. Dubois and Harriet Tubman are two historical figures I'd love to interview. I would love to learn more about their experiences as African Americans in the old American country. 

* What were your greatest challenges?
* How did you overcome these challenges?
* What did you discover in relation to white people?
* What were your hopes for the next generations of African Americans?
* Did you believe in God? How did God communicate to you?
* What was some interesting are people in your generation of African Americans?
* What did you enjoy about writing?

## Have you done any research into your ancestors? What interesting surprises have you discovered? ##
Through my grandmother, and my intuition underly someone's country music on "Going South", I discovered surprises about my ancestor, Dr. Thomas Walker, who discovered the Cumberland Gap. He surveyed the land, led the country West, and explored Kentucky before Daniel Boone. With the Indians as guides, they passed through the native land and discovered the birth of America.

## What do you look forward to every week? ##
Every week, I look forward to Monday mornings. The time of the week to start all the work I have to do. It's a fresh time of the week, a time to restart, and a time to rejoice. On Monday mornings, I love going to school, hearing the laundry machine, and seeing people at Starbucks.

## Were you ever bullied as a child? Tell a story of a time you were bullied, or a time you observed someone being bullied. ##
Yes! People bullied me as a child. I work on letting go of the sense of being bullied, and love people and forgive people. I remember on the late bus I desired to communicate and connect with people, but they made me feel bad for listening in, and people did not let me sit with them at the lunch table. It was awful! But I open up to the Holy Spirit's new ways of blessing people.

## What is one of your greatest blessings? ##
My family has blessed me with love, music, laughs, cheerfulness, athletics, and commitment since I was young I am grateful for many memories of our family reunions where we met and participated in activities harmoniously. I love that this family continues to bless me with emotional support and gatherings on farms and old houses. I trust that there will be many, many, many more good years ahead as adults with the next generation to come.

## When was the last time you felt needed? ##
Every time Nate calls me and asks me to give him a ride, I feel needed. I love hearing his voice, his faith, and his love for his family and the community. I have felt loved when he shared that his mom wanted to meet me, and he made me feel better when he said 'I would be a good mom'. I love feeling the motherly love for his precious daughters. I am grateful to know the Salvation Army and the Up Center, and feel needed there when I compassionately share items with them.

## If you had to do it all over again, how would you reinvent your life? ##
I would not reinvent anything in life. Yes, I have made mistakes. Yes, I have made people afraid of me. Yes, I have felt like I have failed and become angry. I know that if I choose to keep seeing the good in situations, trusting my higher self, and expanding on what I love, that all will reinvent itself for my future in the best way possible.

## What musical instruments would you like to learn how to play, and why? ##
With music being the most romantic artistic expression, I would love to learn to play the mandolin. I come from Virginia, the birthplace of bluegrass-country music. The mandolin supports well playing this fine Virginian folk music that has ties to Scottish, Celtic music. My soul desires to play refined tunes that sound like the wind, the chimes, the birds, the grass, the rose, the flowers, and the river in harmony. The mandolin is a golden instrument, and I would love to play it along with the piano.

## What keeps you from getting a good night's sleep? ##
Ruminating over the past, the things done wrong, and the misssed connections keeps me from getting a good night's sleep. There have been many nights when mortal, scary dreams and anxiety about the future or the things done wrong have prevented me from sleeping. I turn my thought to setting the right desires, loving God, and resting in the consciousness of Love, God's provision.

## Are there any lines that you simply will not cross? ##
Simply I will never cross the line of buying a gun and shooting it. I may have sent reactive, and hateful messages, but I am growing more in touch with the true self that lies beneath the mask. The evil threats masks a clouds of doubt, of insecurity, of disability. Though I have made these threats and sent these images, never will I ever purchase a gun and shoot someone.

## What would you like to be forgiven for? ##
When feeling provoked or made fun of, I have lashed out or lost control. The lash out became so loud that I threatened to kill people. I would like to be forgiven for these awful lashing out emails. It hurts so much to express compassion towards people and not have people reciprocate. I would like to be forgiven for lashing out towards people when no one has responded. I would also love to be forgiven in relationships so that if I find healthy relationships, and someone who feels like a 'soul mate' people will accept, and support me.

## Do you have anyone in your life that has acted as a mentor to you? Have you ever helped someone else out in this way? ##
Some individuals at EVERFI acted as signficant mentors to me. The lead systems and data architect at EVERFI mentored me, believed in me, and gave me opportunities to work with the Engineering team. A woman on the marketing team was also someone with a vibrant attitude who I looked up to a lot. I have helped people in this way when younger men have reacted out to ask about data science.

## Describe the most beautiful sound you have ever heard. ##
The church bells ringing through my ears make me feel so good. I think them chiming are a beautiful sound. I love the sound of the trees moving with the breeze, and I find peace in the sound of the harmonious silence. There exists a power in silence. Beautiful sounds fill the Earth each and every day. Another one I love is the sound of children laughing from an apartment window.

## You have a child and you have written one piece of advice that will be carried in his/her pocket for life. What is that advice? ##
There is a child within you first. She is innocent, free, light-hearted, and joyful. She has a good sense of humor, and she's quick to get back up and try new things. She loves to sing, and play music, and play with little ones. she also loves the sound of children playing.

For my child, I hope she sees how much love there is for everyone around her. I hope she keeps her childlike sense of wonder and motherly love, and freedom to do what God leads her to do. I hope that she carries in her pocket the advice to not let the weight of the world, and human opinions touch her. I hope she proceeds with love each, and every day.

## Write about the last time you felt guilty. ##
Yesterday, I felt guilty. I reacted on social media yet again. I looked up those people that look like celebrities yet again. I was mean because I felt inescure. I am guilty of feeling insecure, jealous, and like a wretch. I am guilty of carrying that attitude that Emily Dickinson carries - "I am no one!" I am guilty of the need to let go of an infatuation. It is awful. I move on to new, and healthier relationships.

## What is something you have dreamed about? ##
This morning, I dreamed of a roommate, a friend, who recently had a daughter. I dreamed of how much love I had for her, her daughter, and her husband, the father. I love the motherly love, and fatherly love, and restored fatherly love with no insecurity, attacking - just pure fatherly-motherly love supporting in harmony.

In the past, I have listened to music by Al Green and appreciated the African American music in Memphis. It turned from dream to reality, when I met the man whose father played music with Al Green in Memphis. I love the history of African Americans in the city.

## Do you prefer taking risks or having a safety net? ##
Having a net to fall back on supports taking risks. I love to express spontaneously, go on adventures, and test the boundaries to make new discoveries and build new creations. Taking risks supports me stretching myself. The last time I took a risk, I drove across the Arkansas Bridge and some other bridges. My family was there as a safety net, and so was my faith in a higher power.

## What is the best thing you have ever been given? ##
While roaming the streets of Wahington, DC, I met three people from the Muslim faith. The best thing I've been given is the gift of Muslim prayers. knowledge of the Moors, and an understanding of Cairo, Egypt and Spain. The best thing I was given was the chance to help a man in DC and meet a new friend, Bilal.

## Diary Entry - 10 Years in the Future ##
Dear Margaret,
Remember how on this day, 10 years ago, how forgiven you felt for the first time for all the crimes done, and all the wrongs done. You had so much deep love and deep thought for humanity. You started growing in new ways, and waking up old passions for English writing and children's books. You started understanding cultural nuances more clearly, and finding full freedom from suicidal thinking. You had love for family so much on this day 10 years ago, as well as love for the little ones on the street. You let go of the things you needed to be letting go of, and you started learning some of the deeper things you needed to learn. Thank God for moving you forward for 10 years and bringing healing, color, good relationships, full freedom from suicide, and and fulfillment into your life. The sun continues to shine every day.

## Vocabulary Usage ##
There was once a beautiful, *roan* horse. He was not only the prettiest horse; but also the fastest horse. In the fields by the *purling* river, the horses enjoyed racing each other. The *cohesive* pack of horses continued to love to have races desptie the fact that Rapido would win everytime. In fact, the winner of the race was given *farina*. It became a routine to give this prize of farina to Rapido upon finishing the race. One day during the races, an *incoherent* group of bay hourses suddenly attacked the roan horses. The roan horses decided that they needed a reader for the battle against the bay horses. Because of Rapido's *renown* for his *inherent* speed, they *denominated* him as their leader. Upon being chosen, Rapido *hesitated*. He did not believe he would serve as a good leader and claimed that it had to be a *misnomer*. Rapido began to pray to the magical spirit, his fetish, and decided to take on the task of leading his pack of roan horses. Unlike the bay horses, Marido's hroses *adhered* to each other. Their *adhesion* made them stronger. After a very close battle, the roan horses won.

## Letter to Oneself ##
Sweet Margaret,
Do not feel self-conscious all the time; you look beautiful, you make good grades, and you express kindness to everyone when you smile and reach out. Rather than worry about what people think of you, either say hello or give a smile to people instead.

I know you often feel unhappy because of how some of your friends have treated you. Stop dwelling on this though; reach out and meet new friends. Have confidence that by expressing happiness, your right friends will come at the right time.

I know how much kindness and love you have in your heart, so quit hiding behind your shell. Although you still often struggle with inesecurity, I find you being more joyful when you radiate friendliness. After receiving the award of 'Silver Letter Girl' at camp this past summer, you have recognized the importance of spreading smiles, compliments, and hellos, and you have learned to feel more confident with yourself.

I realize that you do not feel as if you are 'good' at any of your activities. Who really cares about your grade on your history test, your one hundred freestyle time, or the number of secnes in which you are? In the end, these things have no importance; your happiness, will be forever necessary. Anyway, in reality, you do so much better than you think you do, and you give so much effort into everything. Your playing '100 years' on the piano in ninth grade at the recital despite not believing in your capability of learning the last two pages in time reflects this.

You are a beautiful teenage girl; you thus need to stop having negative thoughts about your body and looks because it will only have a negative impact. Knowing that you reflect God's perfect image, you will feel more confdient about your looks, your intelligence, and your musical or athletic strengths.

To stop criticizing yourself, you must believe in your strengths and know your great value in the world. Share your love with everyone. Live each day full of greetings, smiles, laughter, and joy.

Much love,
Margaret

# Poetry #
## God Never Fails ##
Just when you feel like you/I have failed, God moves in a miraculous way through a vision, a song, an insight, a friendly neighbor, a job, an act of forgiveness.
God is always bringing us closer to our family, first individually, and then collectively.

## These Feelings Are Univeral ##
These feelings are universal.
The feeling captured in the song are ones everyone has.
Thank you for the musician who put the feelings in words.
I am glad to realize I am not the only one.

## Insight ##
Healing is different from coping. 
Healing is God restoring every cell in your brain and body.
Coping is compensating, covering up, worrying about everything wrong, and overcoming.
Healing is remembering one's childlike self, and true self.
Healing is being honest with oneself.

## Start Each Day with a Question ##
What are you thinking about today?
How can I listen to God more clearly?
How can I repent?
How can I learn something new?
What ideas am I or others thinking about?
How am I letting go of something false?
How can I understand a passage in the rear light?

## Angels Are Everywhere ##
I felt some angel wings.
I saw a feather.
I saw an angel note on a poster on the side of the road.
I heard a song on angels outside of a church.
I heard the birds chirping when I returned home.
Angels are in songs waking us up to our reality.
Angels are everywhere.

I hear angels in the whisper of the wind,
the smile of a friend,
the rustle of the leaves,
the advice from a stranger,
the sympathy of a colleague,
the hugs from a practitioner,
the sharing of accounts with a neighbor.

## Yes, WE Can ##
I had been in a dark place for so long.
I was expressing revenge.
I left so many hateful comments.
I could not believe in myself.
I hated playing music.

And then...something came to life inside me.
My prayer I said for myself - "Yes, I can; Yes, We can" worked.
I picked up my guitar, and I played a little tune.
It felt so good to feel at home within my heart.
It felt so good to feel able and free.
We live in America Reborn.

Someone once said "the amateur builds the ark."
The professionals heal, but nothing can stop the amateur from trying it out too.

It's never too late to try something new.
It's never too late to be reborn.
It's never too late to rediscover the depths of your home.
It's never too late to reawaken to your ancestry.
It's never too late to think a new thought.

What a beautiful earth it is, and what a beautiful child of God there is down deep.
There are reasons to stay alive, indeed.
Anything can be healed.
It's natural.
Yes, we can build a new earth, a new heaven, and restore the land from the ground up, from the South to the North, from the East to the West, from the States to the Sea, from the Sea to the Continents.
Yes, we can. It's called Pangaea. It's called "the one tribe" that we can believe in again and again again after a severe backlash, and a severe breakdown.

## God Reminded Me of a Prayer I Said in the Past ##
God reminded me of a prayer I said in the past.
He heard my prayer. He heard my plea.
I knew I did a good job.
He reminded me that "YES, I CAN", "SI, SE PUEDE", "TODAY IS A NEW DAY" "I CAN WALK FREELY WITH THE LORD."

God whispers with the "still, small voice" in the darkest hours when you need a subtle reminder.
"Yes, we can."
"Yes, we can."
"Yes, we can."
He speaks to the prophets, the listeners of Martin Luther King, Jr. the voice of the "I AM US, YOU ARE ME, I AM YOU".

## Damn Lord, You Did a Good Job ##
It's a new day that has yet to begun, and I already want it to end.
I feel like I have failed.
I feel like trash.
Everyone knows what I've done wrong.

There are failure stories on my left.
There are success stories on my right.
I take up the failure stories, and admit to the wrongs.
I take up the success stories, and thank God for creating me and helping me to overcome.
"Praise the Lord for creating me", I say, with a winning smile on my face. The success stories are just that - "Christ the King living and moving and breathing right on through me".
Damn, Lord. You did a good job. You helped me to forgive. You helped me to bounce back up. And you helped me to reform. You helped me to survive.

## Hey Friend, Let's Share a Good Laugh ##
Hey old friend, it's you again.
I love to see you.
I remember all the things done wrong though.
And sometimes I just have to have a good laugh after things go bang in the night.
Hey friend, let's share some comic relief.
After all that..
It's going to be ok.
It will be ok in the end.

## Lessons from Grandparents ##
Granmama - wide smiles, dancing, greeting people for who they are, lover of color and flowers, lover of the Catholic church
Dattee - deep listener, reader, the human psyche, lover of Church, historian
Nam - lover of the English language, the joy of learning, Shakespeare's plays, Christian Science
Faf - piano playing, hard work, and science

## Grandparents ##
I remember all the stories and lessons my grandparents shared.
The stories they shared sing through me intuitively.
I recall them like a piece of music breathing through me.

I love the Good Lord who "hears my prayers" first thing in the morning when the sun rises, the birds chirp, and there's time to eat blueberry muffins like my grandmother.
I love the sound of "Hello, Gorgeous", saying it's a new day in the neighborhood to appreciate every detail in people's lives.
I love the sound of "You stole my birthday", stated by my grandfather, and the love of books, history, symbolism, and psychology.
I hear the sound of faith running deep through my grandfather's love of church and his family.

I love the stories my other grandmother shares of ancestors discovering the country, family members in the shipping industry, and favorite literature like Faulkner and Shakespeare.
I love the sound of the grandfather clock, the sound of the birds tweeting, and the sound of the bird clock with a glass of water and a dictionary nearby.
I love the laughs shared with my other grandfather, and some good family music playing and family tales.
I love the hugs and affection my grandfather gives.

I love the song of the South singing through the lumber industry and the railroads in Memphis like my great grandfather.
I love the beauty of Soul reflected through my great grandmother during the age of Jazz music in Memphis.
I love the good luck rushing through my great grandfather McCardell's Irish blood.
I love the songs of peace "like a river" sung through my great grandmother.

## What Can America Achieve? Diamante Poems ##
Despair,
enormous, steep,
scorching, perishing, callousing,
The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
bright, energetic,
Hope

## Taking Back the Night ##
Flying into the night sky, I take back the night, where in reality it is a silent night.
I sing with the stars above, where everyone has a place.
In the depth of the darkness of the night, the light shines through the window, and the stars glitter and shine, and light the path.
I know I am held so tightly because of how brightly the light shines.

## Bullying ##
Hello, Mr. Bully
Remember me?
You were a bully.
You picked a fight.
You couldn't pronounce my name correctly.
You acted like I couldn't do my work properly.
Hello, Mr. Bully.
Remember me?
I visited your apartment?
...And you poked fun of me.
You treated me like I was stupid.
...Right in the center of your home.
You patronized me.
Hello, Mr. Bully.
Remember me?
I forgave you.
...But you denied me.
You put yourself on a pedestal.
You treated me like I asked for weird favors of you.
Hello. Mr. Bully.
You are part of a church with Celebrities.
And I am never enough, never competitive enough.
Thank you for provoking me.
I see all the selfies online.
I watch all the Celebrities.

...Don't worry.... I fought back. I retaliated. I sent images of guns. I became a bully back. I became passive aggressive out of anger. I started harassing people. I learned from Malcolm X.

...But Child, seriously... The correct approach is to stop the bullying, Let people speak up for themselves, Be more patient, observant, and considerate.

## Prison in My Own Home ##
Before the quarantine, I became a prisoner in my own home.
I felt like I was quarantined before the quarantine.
I felt like I was imprisoned before being imprisoned.
I felt like I was ostracized, yet connected before feeling close to losing it all.
I am compassionate, but I became something that I am not.
I became something that does not represent my true self.
I am genuine and real, but I became fake, a fraud, and spiteful.
I was afraid, I felt hurt from opening up.
I hated my sexuality.
God was there, but I was not paying full attention.
He was right, goodness was running after me, and angels proved that "goodness was running after me",
but willfulness, heaviness, and pain took over and used me.
Knowing what's right, but doing what's wrong will lead to prison.
Complaining when I could pause, and being grateful will lead to prison.
Hitting back when I can forgive will lead to prison.

## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
With a heart yearning to express itself.

In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
With ivory yearning to be tickled.

'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
With stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
and in return she receives a great gift.

Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
Her eyes no longer shed tears.
Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
Her heart has found freedom.
And her mind has found relief.

She is now content
With the company of a friend.

## A Poem for a Marriage, a Wedding ##
In your weddedness to God,
your union eternal exists
in a house undivided.

In weddedness to God,
I am grateful to share
happiness with Mary for 
3 generations of Furr women.

What blesses one blesses all,
so the union can only bless everyone.

## The Correct Prayer ##
The correct prayer is 'Shepherd, Show me how to love'
'how to love as God loves'
'through the darkness'
I love to shift my perception to see people as God's daughters and sons

## Unconditional Love ##
Even after I've done something wrong, I can feel the love within.
It's coming up for me to love all of those around me.
Anything else is worry, and human judgment.
I can drop this, and walk freely with the Lord, and the Love within.

## Attitude on Life ##
I have sounded and attacked like President Donald Trump in some ways.
Donald Trump supports people with valid points. Concerns over infrastructure, technology, agriculture, and preserving what's best in the Republic are valid.
I have met President Barack Obama. The purpose of life is to transform. All of humanity is transforming at once.
I aspire to sound, and be thoughtful, and secure like Present Barack Obama, who I have met.
I am interested in party switching, and the progress in The United States of America.
I reflect on the ideals of home, Reconstruction and Civil Rights, integration, and more.

## God Stills the Storm ##
God stills the storm, literally and figuratively, holds the rain off, lets man worship with the Sun shining, and causes the rainbow to peek through after the rain.

## A System of Ideas ##
"You, oh God, are the source and circumference of being.
Thank you God, that you work through us individually as distinct ideas.
Thank you God, for knowing where each idea needs to be to bless, uplift, and be a healing influence.
Thank you, God, for your system of ideas. We abide in you, you abide in us. What blesses one, blesses all."

The idea that one shares sparks an idea for another to appreciate and share.
That idea that another appreciates and shares motivates an idea for someone else to work with.
There's a system of ideas, constantly moving, constantly inspiring, constantly renewing, and remembering, and constantly uplifting.

## Confidence ##
"with faith"..."in God"
Being so one with God that one can be happy for all of those around you.
Being able express help to someone who seems to be struggling and being confident in his or her abilities.
Feeling at ease in the body.
Being able to admit to to mistakes and accept rebukes with joy for how to become better.
Being so rooted in God that there's a knowledge that God's idea is fit somewhere.
Being free from the pull to compare or judge or feel judged.

## The Harmony of True Business ##
"Union in its highest meaning is the universal union of God and man, divine Principle and idea. True management, since God is infinite must be God's absolute government of His perfect, spiritual universe, including man. Mary Baker Eddy unites in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (p. 209), 'Mind supreme over all with its formations and governing them all, is the central sun of His own systems of ideas, the Life"

"I stand in union with you.
I am in union with everyone I meet.
We meet in the spirit of compassion, the letting go of evil beliefs, and the desire to grow together to become more loving, more whole, and more unified.
I have made similar mistakes as you.
I have succeeded in ways similar to you.
We move in union with all of humanity at once."

## Speak Gently ##
"Speak gently!
It is better far to rule by love, than fear
Speak gently, let not harsh words mar
The good we might do here!

Speak gently!
Love doth whisper low
The vows that true hearts bind;
And gently Friendhip's accents flow;
Affector's voice is kind.

Speak gently to the little child!
It's love be sure to gain
Teach it in accents soft and mild.
It may not long remain."

## Silence the Waves ##
Silence the waves, 
oh my soul
oh my soul
you are my source of peace
when the fear and the rage
kick and scream
God is always still there

Thank you God for your Son
the one who stilled all so well.

## Ocean, Sand ##
Ocean, sand. It fills the whole Earth.

## Connectivity ##
The ocean
THe rivers
The roots below the ground
The interstate
The stars

Continuous. Circle. Rhythm. Structure. 

## Working with EVERFI ##
I was grateful that through the doubt, God intuitively led me to a place just right for me and everyone, where I was integrated with family members and community members doing their life work in the world.
I was grateful to deliberately choose to work for a leader who loved African American history and shared African American history.
I was grateful to deliberately choose to help people understand how perception can shift behavior, though I did not fully understand that at the time.
I was grateful to appreciate harmony expressed in the workplace with people from all different cultural perspectives in the country and the world.
I was grateful to learn about the Natives in Montana, learn about the beloved people from Kentucky, learn about the technologists from California, and learn about the Americans in Washington, DC.
I was grateful to gain an understanding of what it means to feel "white privilege" in the workplace while loving what those from other cultural backgrounds are offering the world, the nation, the community, and the business world.
I was grateful to see the spirit of compassion being expressed by people in the workplace, with the darkness in the world being transformed into light.
I was grateful for company-wide events that brought people together in union twixt the darkness and the light.
I was grateful to be part of the "THIS IS IT" moment when things started booming, roaring, becoming the full thing.
I was grateful to see the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. shared in an engineering class being reflected through the business.
I was grateful to build solutions and be a part of the "Smart Things Should Build Things Movement".
I didn't know everything there is to know about African American History, but I was grateful to start a lifelong journey of appreciating the country, learning about perception, learning about people, working in teams, learning about African American History, and preventing violence on the basis of sex and race.
I was grateful to defend true womanhood, the "Princesses of Peace" who are able to lead, and appreciate true manhood.


----------


People may come from different perspectives, different sides, different points of view, but unite in the divine interest, expressing their talents in original, heart-felt ways.

## Exploring The Controversy ##
A flag is a sign, and a symbol.
I can understand how people feel like the Confederate flag represents good things about Southern culture, Southern heritage, and the birth of the American Country.
The people waving the Confederate flag or wearing Confederate symbols are not bad. They express joy, they express light-heartedness, they express innocence, they express a love of people, and they express a desire to learn, grow, and improve.
The Civil War, however, was a war over an enslaved race, not just a war over land and economy. It offends people because it represents also dark things like slavery, Southern patriarchy, a false sense of dependency which leads to "benevolent racism, and benevolent sexism", and systemic violence and oppression.
The traumatic memories of a past of enslavement have still come up, waiting to be shared to inform and educate people on what's not right in our country's past, and what's not right in human relations.
Land and economy are part of the South, but land and economy expand to the North and the West.

## The Virginia Flag ##
Such a beautiful blue symbol, representing freedom from tyranny and the reign of Virtue, with signs for Liberty, Eternity, and Agriculture.

## The External and Internal Oppressor ##
People condemn resentment, and anger for oppression or bad treatment.
If someone is being patient for an extended period of time towards someone mistreating them, neglecting a part of who they are, undermining them, condescending them, patronizing them, or misunderstanding them, while they are forgiving them, the internal oppressor will seem like resentment with guilt, internal mockery, a sense of threat, self-hatred, and anger towards the ongoing enabling of negative behavior.
The internal oppressor is the external oppressor internalized.
The love from God shields man so that no form of human hatred can reach, and the love from God delivers man from this internal or external oppressor that leads to more aggression internally towards oneself or externally towards others.

## Spiritual Lessons From Every Relationship ##
A lesson on reading and speaking up.
A lesson on singing, playing music, and music history in the South, especially in Norfolk.
A lesson on how Black Lives are Amazing in Norfolk.
A lesson on the Spanish roots of African Americans.
A lesson on the Jamaican roots of African Americans.
A lesson on not stalking people on social media and detaching from the situation.
A lesson on not romanticizing the South.
A lesson on the history of the United States of America.
A lesson on keeping the tone of conversation cheerful.
A lesson on keeping email messages tidy and clean.
A lesson on forgiving people and treating people as brethren.
A lesson on appreciating people's names.
A lesson on giving candid feedback to people and listening to people well.
A lesson on being ok with solitude and being ok with being single.

## The Love, and The Goodness within vs. Society and Culture ##
Man, and Woman are dependent on Love.
Love moves us to appreciate one another.
Love moves us to smile at each other.
Love moves us to forgive, and share a good laugh.
Love moves us to pause, and stop reacting.
Love moves us to understand someone who is different, and really listen.

## A New Day ##
It's a new day.
Open your window to the sunlight.
Take a deep breath and smile.
Welcome humanity, and the world into your heart with love.
Close the door to peering into the lives of others.
Trust they are right where they are meant to be.

## A New Day ##
It is a new day, the fan is blowing, the water is running, the sound of silence plays in the background.
I made mistakes, reacted out of anger yesterday, yet again.
But the sun is dawning on a new day, and I can choose to reform, and let go.
The sun is shining on the Earth from a new angle, shedding new perspectives on things.

## It's A New Day ##
It's a new day for the sun to shine
for the birds to chirp
for me to meet a new friend
I love to sing out loud
and let go all of the doubt
and feel love in my heart
for everyone
It's a new day for the flowers to bloom
for the rain to fall
for the neighbors to wave
I love to skip out side
and run to the park
and feel joy in my heart
with everyone

## Mortal Mind and Divine Mind ##
Mortal mind wants to assert itself through fear, through judgment, through offense, through threat.
Divine Mind asserts itself through peace, through compassion, through empathy, through understanding, through patience, through prayer.
Mortal mind wants to control through pressure, through anger, through manipulation, through jealousy.
Divine Mind wants to control through morality, through the consciousness of good, through helpfulness, through good character.

----------


## The Shadow Side ##
"Yea, though I walk through the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me for all the rest of the days of my life."
This is the shadow side to who you are. There's a gentle soul beneath it all, waiting to unfold into greatness, and ready to smile at all of the humanity and all of the human race. There's a heart waiting to sing in the post office and the laundry room.
It's amazing, and beautiful how God led his people out of slavery. It's not God's purpose for man to be enslaved. God leads his people through the wilderness.

## Sprouting Up ##
An idea from within sprouts up.
It starts as a small seed of intuition reminding someone of something latent, a memory of the past, a tale in the family.
Cultivating a love for this small seed lets it grow into a greater reality.
It grows and grows into its full self.
The idea from within the home that's already there becomes a full garden, a full way of being.

## What You Water Grows ##
What you water grows.
What you express gratitude for expands.

## The Ocean ##
The ocean crashes every day upon the shore.
The deep waters of God are where the sin is stirred out.
The holiness of God can cleanse what is wrong away.

## Connected, Yet Ostracized ##
When I am feeling connected yet ostracized, I want to yell out, but I pause 
and remember the values to live out with the connections, not the connections themselves.

## Mothering ##
Forming new memories, starting a fresh, new insights, new ways of seeing things, new ways of being come to me like a mom
watching a newborn baby learning how to see the world each day freshly and naturally.

## Pregnancy ##
It feels weird to me that
another human body can grow out of a woman's body
...But really there's a science to this.
Physicial connection grows out of love and trust, and a spiritual connection.
Walking around with another being in your body looks weird to me.
...But some people think it looks beautiful.
...And doing that requires love and trust.

In reality, people exist in Christ, in God, we find our strength,
All the right ideas grow out of everyone.

Beyond physical reproduction,
there is spiritual renewal
thorugh spiritualizign thought, letting go of falsehood.

## Right Desire vs. Wrong Desire ##
Like produces like.

What is in desire will lead to an action.

A right desire leads to love, better ethics, spirited growth in grace, new understanding, new ways of seeing the world.

What is a wrong desire?
A wrong desire leads to frustration, roadblocks, anger, and strife.

I love egalitarianism.
I don’t worship people. But sometimes I feel like people are superior to me, and sometimes I have felt I am superior to others. 
I worship the song of Love at the post office, and the Fed Ex office.
I love that I am Southern. 

This. Is. Who. I am. 


## Song of the Night ##
True Love is not cheap.
True Love is happy for others.
True Love apolgoizes and accepts repercussions for wrongdoing.
True Love never fails.
True Love treats enemies like brothers.
True Love commits to a team over self.
True Love rejoices in welcoming others.
True Love trusts in the best for their neighbors.
True Love listens to others' admonishments with care.
True Love knows how to rest and get back up.
True Love is always moving.
True Love is never divorced from itself.
True Love knows itself for eternity.
True Love is loving all humanity ta once.
True Love weathers the storm.

## Love ##
Reaching far for and extending widely this love for you.
You are already part of my family. 
You remind me of people I already know.
This love continues for ever and never stops.
It expands forever with all of humanity growing as well.
It loves you to the moon and back.
And dances with the stars after you are dead.
It picks you up when you fall.
And forgives you when you've failed.
It remembers everything true at heart about you.
And synchronizes with you.
It knows you with all your full glory and colors.
It knows how to guide and protect you.
It nudges you always to the right intuitions and ideas.
It sees the light in you when darkness and discord are all around.

## Harmony the Real, Discord the Unreal ##
God harmonizes everything.
Harmony is the real, discord is the unreal.
God knows what I need to learn, how I need to gain a new insight, and how I need to understand something.
God knows what to draw out of his people.
God is never mocked, and God is never making fun of people.

## The Darkness ##
In the dark, when I am all alone
The light flashing through the car in front of me can't scare me
The light within guiding me with intelligence, peace, security is so strong as the light flashing through the car

## A Romantic Vision ##
A rose, a flower blossoming through the wintery blast, the darkness of the night.

## A Dose of Reality ##
The sounds of the neighborhood working together in harmony for good.

## Words Cannot Express ##
Words cannot express the deep things of God.
Awareness of the Christ is key to healing.
God moves people with compassion to discover the Christ expressed in everyone.

## Confidence ##

## "What Beauty There Is In Silence" ##
"What beauty there is in silence".
In silence, there's true strength with no one telling her to find her strength.
In silence, there's knowledge without words.
In silence, there's space to muse.
In silence, there's the reality of someone's heart beating without any verbal communication.
In silence, there's space to stand aghast at and laugh at the ways people push people over, silence people, and ridicule people over quietude.
In silence, there's space to appreciate the mystery of it all, and enjoy the interconnectedness of Life.
In silence, there's the opportunity to say no to the silent arguments masquerading through my thought.


----------


Popular culture speaks subtly. One must think to understand different perspectives on popular culture. One must be alert to subtle, silent arguments telling what one is. Some of popular culture has depth. Some of popular culture expresses Soul. Some of popular culture seems shallow, and watered down.

## Music ##
Music is one form of cultural expression. Intuitively, music shares with people stories - stories of the past, stories of families, and stories of the present; stories of relationships, stories of politics, and stories of nature.

## Your Job ##
Your job is an attitude towards life, and an outlook towards the world and humanity.
Your job is not confined by your job title, your social status, your place.
Your place is in the land of the divine, where ideas in your heart continuously unfold, and are not limited by the job or opinion of others.

## Present, Past ##
"The past unravels. The present is unfolding."

## Home ##
This is a home for divine expression, divine orchestration, divine symphony, divine architecture, divine building, brother birds.

## United ##
United in our being.
Standing in union with one another through loving what's in another's heart and soul.

## The Study of History ##
God's story is forever unfolding.
The Bible is a history book that shares the chronicles of people, and life lessons.
Every individual who is born on Earth is born into an existing story of the collective mankind.
Every individual who is born on Earth has a story being created by God and him or herself.
We are all part of a grand story that is ever-evolving and ever-progressing.
And everyone has a story of his or her own singing through the earth by God to overcome evil with good.

## Life Lessons and the Next Generation ##
Life lessons are continuing in beautiful ways through the next generation.

## Divine Right ##
It's your divine right to be free, whole, singing, healed, joyful, purposeful, employed.

## Morality ##
Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of good, and doing good, where there exists only the righteous thoughts, not the thoughts of want.
Moral freedom founded in the consciousness of joy, and being joyful, where there exists only the desire to see the light in others and be grateful and happy for them.
Is the act life-giving? Then it's morally right.
Is the act loving? Then it's morally just.
Is the act truthful, honest, factual, and just? Then it's morally correct.
Is the act principled, ordered, and balanced? Then it's moral.
The place within where there's moral freedom is where there's a consciousness so filled with love and light, and no room for fear. anger, false judgment, want, or disappointment.

## "Love Chases the Storms Away"
Love and life within chases the storms away.
After the storm, the tree branches lie on the ground.
The leaves have fallen, and the rain has gone away.
The sun reflects through the puddles on the ground.
The water evaporates in the sun that shines.
The residue from the storms falls way.
Life continues with freshness.
The light of love and life chases the storm away, leaving no room for negativity, and only gives room for rebirth and renewal.

## Quarantine - Regeneration ##
So much died, panicked, attacked, reacted in anger leading into the quarantine.
There were so many riots.
It was all like dead leaves on a tree losing its value, its integrity, its originality, its source of life.
Even during the quarantine, riots, pain, frustration, anger, and attacks continued.
But so did the birth of new ideas awaken us, the regeneration of old, valuable ideas renew us, and the fading out of dead leaves clear our thoughts.
The harshness of winter, when all is cold, bleak, lost, dark, angry, and fallen, giving way to a full-time spring, and summer.
Flowers cannot bloom until the dead leaves fully fall off.

## Religious Liberty ##
Christian Science embraces all religions, all churches, all races, and all of humanity.
The Christian Science church architecture roots itself in Romanesque architecture.
America does too. America was founded with a love for religious freedom and religious liberty, though there are debates over what this means to people.
The architecture in Charlottesville was rooted in Roman architecture.
I love all the churches, I love all the people, and I love that God forgives everyone and speaks to everyone.

## Opening Up ##
Opening up to people about the negative thoughts, beliefs in the back of my thought, and things I should not say, feel, or believe. 
How do I work through these thoughts, beliefs, and things?
Opening up, feeling over-exposed, feeling naked, literally or metaphorically.
It leads to discomfort, something to shove down, or anger, and I express anger.
This is not true opening up. This opening up is the discarding of darkness to be transformed into light.

Opening up to the Holy Spirit, sense of joy, compassion, life, and childlikeness.
This spirit of man, born of the Holy Spirit, is within everyone.
It is reflected through the shadows in the back of people's thoughts, shining brighter than the shadows.
It is greater than the physical appearance of man.
Opening up to the sense of love within opens us up to people correctly to open up to the love within another.
Opening up to the light causes man's eyes to light up with a sparkle and a glow.
This is true opening up.

## The Democratic Republic and the Debate Inside My Head ##
Two parties of people govern the nation. Each party represents a set of ideas for how to represent the people, a set of philosophies for how to govern people with order, and a set of ways to handle collective challenges.
No party has absolute control. The party in control has representative power over a set of people and over the collective whole. The party not in control also represents another set of people.
The governmental structure builds in a space for dialogue, or a debate that gives room for disagreement that can yield to agreement.
Not everyone has to agree, but everyone should point their thought to the greater good that supports the life, love, and soul that exists within people's hearts and minds.
New ideas can evolve out of conflict and disagreement, leading to something better than before.
A new nation is built everytime conflict erupts so destructively.
A republic (government is a "public matter"): "a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch". The republic constitutes the entire region. The national government represents each state's government, which should represent the people, including the minority, in each state. Representatives decide the rules and make the laws. Education helps to provide people with liberty, life, happiness, health, and purpose. Everyone has a piece of the representation, and a right to function and to live well. The majority rules, and the minority is represented to protect the "inalieanble rights" of the people.
A democracy (government is ruled "by the people"): "a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives". The government supports everyone having an informed voice, the government represents the majority of the voice to meet their needs, and voices make the laws through their votes. Everyone has "inalieanable rights".
The debate over which set of ideas, or system of government runs in my head. I feel like I can understand both sides, I can see from both perspectives, I may not understand enough to make a firm judgment, I may not know all of the details to voice a strong opinion.
The United States of America is a Democratic Republic in that the Government is ruled by an elected group, hears and supports the minority's voice, and expresses the needs of the majority. The United States of America is a representational democracy.

## I am Whole ##
Dropping the narrative that I have made a mistake. Taking on the narrative that I am whole.
God's way is higher than my way.
And "all works together for good" when seeking to understand, desiring to progress, yearning to improve, going within to love more, working to apologize, asking to learn, working to perceive correctly in the light.

## Children's Play and Hallucinations ##
Little children play with dinosaurs, dress-up clothes, Alphabet letters, and wish lists to Santa Clause.
Once in my twenties, people felt like I was tripping. Actually, I was tripping. I had been so depressed and stressed and felt so overweight that I starved myself for a whole semester. I was imagining things like a little kid does. None of it was real; it was twisted - the images and sounds were distorted, and they were not the full, big picture that God has.

I had so much work, and it all felt so overwhelming. I worked all night in the politics building with so many papers to write and exams to take. It was late at night and early in the morning in the political science building, and I was listening to English and Scottish Christmas music. It felt like a childhood game was going on around me while checking Facebook and other computer programs; my imagination went wild while writing poetry on envy, money, family, farms, and UVA, and I felt like I was entering a game on the computer. I wrote some weird lines of poetry; it's embarassing and awkward to look back on.

After having slept so little, done so much work, and eaten so little, everything felt so heavy while walking back to my dorm room. I even felt like I saw a high school teacher riding his bike outside. Everything felt "stranger than fiction", as they say, but I could still feel God. My roommate was there; she was beautiful, strong, smart, and interesting and she was from Hong Kong - but I was not fully sound mentally. It felt like the dinosaurs were roaring, and I had traveled back in time into the age of the dinosaurs. It felt like a terrorist attack. I could not move. I felt stuck, frozen, and after starving myself for so long, I rushed to go eat, where I felt the love of the people in the dining hall.

After leaving the dining hall to walk into the cold, brisk, winter air, it felt like I was in the age of the Vietnam War. Everything felt cold, gray-brown-dark-red-green in the depth of winter. I felt confused. Something felt off. I could not articulate what felt off. I knew God, and a sense of childlike joy and discovery in my heart; but I was fascinated by the distorted sense of reality.

I wrote emails madly to a professor, sounding like a lunatic or a mad woman. I met with him face-to-face, in person. I remember sharing how I felt like I could understand the primitive nature of the Alphabet purely through intuition.

Then I entered into the library and saw my friend. It felt almost like I was walking through a children's book or a video game. The light was shining through the darkness in the library, and the books of college guys sitting at desks reminded me of my dad there in the 1980s. I remember the angel voices, the angel monument, and the beauty of the Chinese students working at their desks.. and then I remember going to the church nearby to see people dancing like children.

I then heard voices - like middle school girls laughing, maybe gossiping but probably not, and high school guys bullying me and laughing at me. 
I had felt forgiveness for him, saw the light in him, but the voices became so loud. It was a distorted sense of reality. It was not really him. It was the ghost of him, and the ghost of me. It was the false him, and the false me. I rushed into his fraternity house, saw the light shining through window in the dark while the Christ light was speaking with the "still, small voice" in my heart, his heart, all of our hearts. I acted out some movie characters, like Mary Poppins, who taught children to "find the fun in every job that must be done", and Queen Elizabeth, who represents the ability for women too to govern and understand politics, and he called the police on me so I could be taken care of in the hospital.

It all felt like a computer game in some way inside the fraternity home and then in the hospital. Interacting with the cops, and handing over credit cards to people like women do when feeling financially dependent on men, can feel freaky especially after working to forgive someone and see the goodness and light in them. My romantic heart came up in self-defense, claiming the rose in my heart that needed to be nourished and watered. I loved all the nurses, and doctors, and people in the hospital, but I felt like I could hear the voices of my family - my cousins, my aunts. All the sounds felt like I was in the North Pole with kitchen sounds, and voice receivers; "what the hell is going on?" I remember questioning in the hospital, but I was tripping and imagining things in the way a little kid imagines Santa Clause and dinosaurs. The false senses were not real. They were distorted sounds and images because the human, mortal mind draws false associations between things.

My dad arrived, and so did my mom. They comforted me. They helped me feel the Christmas light that shines through the darkness and heals the "grinch that steals Christmas." The grinch was trying to steal Christmas. The grinch had been trying to steal Christmas all year, but when coming back down to Hooville, from the top of the majestic, blue Appalachian mountains, the grinch realized it had no power, and I could feel the light of the Christ speaking.

There was restoration between the bullying guy and me. There was some healing. There was some light shining through the darkness during the Christmas season. I had opened up to strangers, and felt exposed for thoughts that were not really mine. It was not really me.

At first I felt embarassed when looking back and remembering this all. Then I read some books for children, and realized that it's ok for children to imagine, so I could think of an adult tripping like a child imagining things, and it makes it more light.

I got into trouble, I violated the boundary of the fraternity house that my dad and peer were in, and my brother too; but translating the terroristic, violating images of thought into childlike images of thought sheds light on the situation.

## It's a Southern Thing ##
The rural south seems insular.
Women seem less educated, less cultured, and dependent on men.
People in the south seem racist.
The society around them expects them to work strictly in education and nursing.
The society around them expects them to become married and depend on men, and be less employed.
Women with blonde hair and blue eyes seem like damsels-in-distress, always smiling, and heartbreaking cowgirls, complaining about failure, rejection, and harassment.

Partly, I wanted to do a debut with an organization that waves a Confederate flag because I desired to belong, be accepted, and I desired the social status that my family had; but partly I felt like it was antiquated, and I was concerned for African Americans. The Confederate flag represents systematic racism, and I sought to understand political, cultural, and social nuances.

Martin Luther King, Jr. did not like organizations that raised Southern Belles, and I cared about healing from racism since I was a first year student in college. I carry prejudices towards African Americans still, but I remember participating in groups at a university with self-segregation with African Americans. After experiencing rejection and communication breakdowns in humanities classes, I starved myself for a semester because rejection from traditionally Southern groups is painful, but I reformed and engaged with people from more diverse groups and asked an African American man to my sorority date function. I also reformed in becoming less prejudiced towards the Caucasian race in the South, and appreciating their joy, innocence, and light-heartedness, qualities which I express also.

There are societal and cultural projections on African Americans. These societal projections can feel very loud, but black men are so intelligent, and free, and innocent, life-giving, and have good sense of humor.

At church, I feel like I was trying to break away from the pull to depend on men and the pull to fear the male-dominated workplace, I feel like I was trying to break away from the continuous search for a boyfriend or a husband, and be free from the cowboy-damsel-in-distress stereotypes, but somehow the claims became more aggressive.

## Thinking Above Political Lines ##
Every individual is God's son or daughter, and his or her thought has the freedom to rest above the political lines and social statuses drawn in the country or the world through loving each individual. Leaning on the divine substance, women can express feminine and masculine qualities, men can express masculine and feminine qualities; buoyantly, women and men can fluidly work in different spheres of the economy and depend wholly on God, the "consciousness of good", not any false beliefs about mankind.

My mom was a traditional Southern mom, but she encouraged me to become a career woman. I became more of a career woman because I felt angry about feeling "too simple" like some people from the rural south do, too dependent on men, and incapable of understanding everything I read in the political economy; I also felt critical of aspects of the domestic economy because of how I heard my mom share opinions and her perspective, and since then, I have felt cut off from the sense of Southern home, even though I feel "home" as the "consciousness of good." I learn to bring my work in the political economy into the domestic economy, recultivate my love of home, and use skills in the home.

My mom always felt like the ideal Southern woman, and I have felt angry sometimes over that; or when I see other women seeming like the ideal Southern woman, I have felt inferior. But I learn to express gratitude for all mankind, and love the consciousness of good more and more.

More broadly, I love home on earth with all of humanity.

## **Listening to country music inspired me to write some poetry on solitude, being single, independence and breaking up with beliefs.** ##

## The Lone Bird ##
The bird flies in solitude across the land.
It lifts its wings alone so gracefully.
I'd like to be like that lone bird, unafraid to show dignity on the fence, possessed by quiet strength.
Freely able to sail through the clouds and onto the wire alone.
Fully loved when my heart is aching.
At peace when my words are ignored.
Loving when I see someone new.
Relieved that I can fly freely with love and peace in my heart, and still sing my song too.
No song is too simple. No song is too advanced. All of humanity is singing a song with this lone bird on the fence.
My heart soars higher, my eyes look deeper, my vision grows further when he lets go.

## Fighting for Her Independence ##
She lets go of the gun, and she lets the reign of Truth, Life, and Love in.

Through the fight for her independence, there is ground beneath her feet.
Trust, love, and joy sings through the depths of her soul,
and through her light, all the colors on the Earth feel embraced.

People want to keep her passive, helpless, and dependent.
People want to be violent towards her.
People want to keep her held back in chains.
People want to keep her silent, and ask why she doesn't speak up or use her voice.

She lets go of these claims.
She lets go of this ugliness. 
She lets go of this uncultured and uneducated beast.

She lets go of the envy towards people more educated, cultured, and fitting into the ideal mold.
She lets go of the weakness.
She has a true strength and light-hearted spirit within her that can overcome so much falsehood and darkness.
With each new day under the Sun, she opens her heart to more independence, love, and innocence that can shine through the land that belongs to everyone.

## The Freerider ##
She's a woman who can stand on her own two feet.
She knows how to straddle a horse alone,
block and tackle like a true innovator,
and pull her self up by the bootstraps like an entrepreneur.
She may have made mistakes in the past,
but there's a golden light in her heart freed from the chains of people's opinions and the internalized oppressor.
She may feel held back from understanding herself and expressing herself, but she can gain dominion over her heart.
So much freedom is there for her ahead.
There's a gigantic frontier of possibilities and internal peace.
She's a lover of knowledge, and true education with a home full of books.
She has a heart for people that forgives and sings.
A true woman she is, expressing ladylike qualities and poise like a true Queen indeed.

## Our Country ##
Everyone in our country are like stars shining on the American flag.
The light can't burn out.
The people are so innocent.
The water flows steadily through the channels, giving us peace and restoration.
Forever in the night, the stars do shine.
Our hearts burn.
Everyone in the country, everyone on the Earth has a light like the star that burns, and shines.
God holds us all amazingly in tact, in one grand brotherhood, and sisterhood.

Our country is home to all, including the red, white, and blue,
where we treat our enemies like brothers
find the light in the darkness
appreciate all the colors
reach out to distant family members
"lay low" after injuring a neighbor
no on is superior, no one is inferior
we are all individual, distinct
contributing to the interdependence

## The Union ##
North, South, East, West.
We all stand in this union, 
where everything is interconnected, 
rising above the conflict, the chaos, the discordant beliefs, and the enslavement of man,
finding our common bond, the bridge to the other side, and the joy to love a neighbor another day.

## The Rose Within ##
There is a rose within everyone's heart.
It must be watered, it must be nourished.
The love is strong, and the light is bright, even at night. It is all one with all of humanity.
Nothing is as beautiful as a red rose in the harsh, blasts of a winter storm.

## Healing from Abuse, both the Abused and the Abuser ##
There was no reason to be jealous.
You have it all within, sister.
The qualities are there. The latent talent is there.
You may blossom differently or later, but sister, you spring from the same source, and the ideas are there.
So love your brother, and love your sister. Love must go before you, and you are not estranged.
Sometimes the night must be taken back, the fight within must stop, and the time to be receptive must come.
God does amazing work through the pain, and really opens us up to Her living reality.

## Healing from The Tendency to Fight ##
I want to fight back, react, send an email, kick a door, hit, or write a negative comment.
I want to manipulate the situation to meet my wants.
I want to yell out with anger and express rage to deal with the feelings of insecurity and inferiority.
I want to run away, hide, lay in bed all day, or withdraw.
And I have done these things...
...But I learn to pause...
I learn to think things through.
I learn to love more.
I learn to ask better questions.
I learn to apologize.
I learn to forgive.
I learn to see things from a different perspective.
I learn to resurrect.
I learn to exercise self-control.
I learn to write poetry.

## The South ##
What is in the South?
Friendly neighbors, strong families, lightness of heart, good food - grits, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, oyster stuffing, and white houses, good porches, and amazing nurses, and teachers.
Good music - bluegrass, country, the blues, and jazz, and bridges to the West Coast.
Equality for all.
A connection to the land.
A love of home and family.
Freedom from racial, gender, and cultural politics.
Where the country began and started.

## Southern Titles ##
"Ladies" at home, and the country club, and "women" at work.
"Babygirl" and "babe" on the street, which sounds like a cat call after being raised to be a Southern lady.
Are ["ladies"](https://publicseminar.org/2017/10/why-do-you-call-us-ladies/) just upper-class, wealthy, white women or women from all races, associated with the Confederate flag?
Traditionally, ["ladies"](https://publicseminar.org/2017/10/why-do-you-call-us-ladies/) are just upper-class, rich, white women, but I see members of all races being ["ladies" and "gentlemen"](https://empoweringwomennow.com/23-characteristics-of-a-classy-lady/) in the true sense of being able to take care of a home and do fulfilling work in life.
And I love that homes can include African American art and culture.

## The Country Music and the Healing ##
It healed my relationship to the Country.
I was already from the South, but negative memories of the South and race that infiltrated my thought were chased away.
I already loved the sound of the trains, but it brought me closer to the nation-wide railways.
I was already aware of the lumber industry and my great grandfather's work in it, but it brought me one step closer to it. I learned to love those presently working in the lumber industry.
I already knew Tennessee Blues and Virginia Bluegrass music, but it brought me one step closer to this light-hearted music as well as the Jazz music pictures in Norfolk.
I once took mandolin lessons and played piano, and it led me to dig deeper into myself to play more spontaneously.
I was already from Virginia, but it shed light on West Virginia, nearby, and brought me one step closer to Old Virginia.
I thought I was relating to the South, but it made me aware of the beauty of the West, and the freedom in the South.
I already had ancestors who rode astride, but I grew more aware of the global trend of riding astride.
I had already been to South America, but it brought me more love for the South Americans and Spanish Americans.
I had already been to Scotland and Ireland, but it woke up my memories of a love for Scottish and Irish music.
I had already traveled to the West to visit the natives, but it called my attention to the greater whole.
I had already felt denied by Southern culture, but it woke me up to my Southern mom.
I was already aware of the trucks at the Port and on the roads in Bristol, but it led me to love the truck drivers more everywhere.
I had thought Country music was just for White People, but I realized I already listened to and played country music produced by African Americans.

## At the Root ##
At the root is the same heart responding and reacting to the same culture. 
The same heart is at the root singing, appreciating, and interpreting.

## Cars on the Roads #
In the red, white, and blue, where there are all sorts of people.
Every one is individual.
All sorts of cars of many hues are driving on the same roads.
Weaving in and out through the cities and the land, we all live in one country under the God in which we trust.
## engineering, math, the distance between cars, everyone is individual, a sea of cars ##

## America ## 
Digging into the depth of the earth, wedded to the earth,
where the soil is thick
and knows her story
and leaves room for all to grow in their own way.

## Stars Twinkling At Each Other ##
In the darkness of the night, all the stars twinkle and shine.
They are all loving each other like bright lights glowing, and flickering.

--I see you winking at me.
--I wonder what good you have to share with me.
--I wink back and wish you the best.

--This love is like a star twinkling at another star,
--sharing the light in the middle of the night,
--dancing with one another in the symphony of the night sky.

--Everyone can see you winking at me.
--They can see the start of a new friendship.
--It's like all the other stars in the sky sharing the light and love
--In a universal dance of peace, love, and joy.

## Healing from Weird Words ##
Oh my gosh!
Those words in all capital letters I sent.
Those hateful comments.
That jealous message.
Those awful reactions.
I am so sorry.

I know, it's so petty.
I was so hateful.
I was trying to seek revenge.
I felt so hurt, and so offended.
It's hard to take back.

Oh my gosh!
I was making fun of myself.
I was afraid of the bullying.
I felt so angry and so much of the weight and blame.

Thank you for forgiving me.

I am glad to write with more order, grace, and punctuality.

## Healing from Email Attacks ##

## Opening Up, Anger, Strife ##
Shoving the things down that I should not share.
Feeling uncomfortable, embarassed, and over-exposed.
But it's ok.
I can rise up another day.

## Industry 2.0 ##
I am a highway girl.
I love to pray when I drive.
My thought moves slowly.
The white and brown trucks remind me of modern-day horse and buggy cars.
I have the freedom to process information.
I can hear the beauty of the sounds.
I open my eyes to new people in roadside hotels and at gas stations.
I cherish the order and harmony of all the cars driving together through mid-day traffic.
I remember the long drives from VA through TN and back down to NC.

The internet is the new highway to Truth.
Anything and everything can be uncovered, discovered, and captured.
There's so much love, joy, happiness, beauty, and grace to share online.
There are so many words of wisdom to express.

Everyone interconnects online in the way the highway connected people in new ways.
New connections can be made, and old connections can be revived.
But be careful what you share. All the information moves so quickly. Some of it is advertisement, like the billboards on the side of the road, with an attention-seeking image, but no authentic response back.
And there's a quick way to vent, compare, compete, or be exposed to things you may not want to be exposed to.

## The CTO of Your Home ##
Being the CTO of your house, your home.
Controlling your searches, your emails, your time online, your social media usage.
Being aware of the boundaries.

## Georgia ##
Traditionally, there's racism in Georgia.
As I look more deeply, I see how White Americans are innocent.
The land has been taken back, restored, and freed from slavery.
There are white-only plantations, and African Americans who have taken back the land.
There are White Americans and African Americans eating together at diners.
Thank you, God, for the good you do through your Christian brothers and sisters.
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s work was so powerful.
Your eyes were on the prize all along, leading your people along.

## I LOVE THE BLACK MAN ##
I am grateful for car rides with an African American man proclaiming that "I LOVE the Black man" after four other outings with African American men.
I am grateful for conversations with him about a key African American leader.
The stereotype of African Americans is that their neighborhoods are dangerous, in debt, in poverty.
The stereotype of African Americans is that they are borderline criminals.
They do so much good, however.
This is the stereotype.
Everyone has a story. Everyone has a past. Everyone has a future. This is only the beginning of America's journey to freedom. I believe in the Black man.

## Why Am I Being Tracked? ##
Why am I being tracked?
Why is someone viewing all my posts that I share?
Why is someone looking me up when I don't know them?
Why is someone knowing everything about me when I have never met them?
Why is someone using my information?

## Same Roads, New View ##
I have driven down these roads before
but I see them, the people, the homes in a new light.
Everything grows richer, deeper, fuller, and more alive.
I see the beauty, not the poverty.

## Looking Deeper, Looking Wider ##
Looking deeper, looking wider, I find my home, and the truth within
I find the place where everyone, everything is interconnected
where bad memories are replaced, new pictures captured

## Letting It Go and Moving On ##
I let it all go, and I got in the car.
I drove through Bristol, Nashville, Memphis, and across the Arkansas Bridge to West Memphis.
Then I drove through Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and the Rust Belt, across another bridge over the Ohio River.
I met some new friends, stayed in some hotels, heard some new stories, read some new books, saw new artwork,
and traveled back down West Virginia Country Roads, where everything felt like home in a new way.
Driving by the train tracks, feeling the freshness of the Rivers, and seeing the Americans doing their work,
America felt new, yet the same.
I remembered my family, and the deep, deep roots that run through the ground.
I saw why people want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, but it has always been great and will always be great.

## Letting It Go ##
I never wanted to let this situation go
Everything felt so close to home
I had prayed for so long
But I let it go and moved on

## It Starts At the Port ##
It starts at the port.
Every morning, the orange, green, white, and blue trucks drive from the shipyard to the streets.
The trucks drive harmoniously down Hampton Roads like the birds do when they fly.
Where do they go? From the driveways in the port city to the shipyard to the country roads.
There's a beautiful chain of freight traveling through the port cities and then through the country.
And some have American flags hanging in the windows.

## It All Started in Virginia ##
It all started in Virginia.
Some people chose liberty and traveled across the seas.
They had no idea what they would discover, but they discovered some new land for the mark of freedom.
Not everything was perfect when they discovered this new land.
There were hypocrites, and there was violent behavior.
But they launched the way for some pioneering people. // But the sail launched the ground landing for some pioneering people.

## From Port to Port ##
From port to port the sun shines in every place from different angles.
We all look to the same sun from different corners of the Earth from different places in the Universe.

## Roots ##
You can claim what you were born to be.
Your roots may have dried out, but your roots run deeply into the ground.
Dig within deeply, remove the weeds, and discover the glory.
The glory, the beauty, the soul of Soul is there.

## Home and Music ##
Home is where it all begins.
There's a place for music and you all in my heart forever.
Childlike memories of light, dancing, and merriment last forever.
No hurt can reach the child within, we all express this sweet, childlike innocence.

## Healing, It Starts at Home ##
"'Twas Love Who Traced a Bow of Promise on the Cloud"
The Full Promise Came

Healing, it starts at home
with life and love
It expands out into the community that
unfolds forever and ever
in love, one remain
Thank you for your structure, and overlapping spheres, oh Lord,
You manitain our spheres as the stars that shine
Thank you, God, for always being with us.

## The Sound of Silence ##
The sound of silence is so grand, so great, so beautiful.
In the silence, I can hear the greatest music, the greatest song of all.
In the silence, I feel the leaves, the rain, the sun, the breeze, the road, the trucks, the goodness of all the people on both side of politics.
I made myself vulnerable, started opening up, felt guilt and then shame, and then embarassment, then violent, and then angry.
I opened up in the wrong way.
There was silence, no response, feelings of inferiority. I fell, and stooped so low in violence.
I rose up higher with a bounce in my step, a love for someone else, and a resilient sense of being.
I tried to apologize, I saw more deeply, learned grander lessons, and felt the true sound of silence in my own heart rather than the sound of silence coming from someone not accepting of me reaching out.
Every heart is so beautiful, and I know this true sound of silence is within everyone's heart, but the false beliefs, the dark clouds cover the true sound of silence.

## Children's Play ##
Playing on the keys without words
I discover a joy and a light in the sound that reminds me of little kids on a playground
No words are needed because the color and the youthfulness are in the sound bouncing with joy

## The Agitation in America ##
When the riots fell down on the White house, the breakdowns happened at the Confederate Monuments, and the sense of loss and of lack stirred up agitation,
the American dream felt out of reach to people.
The American dream is not lost. What is great about America remains in memory, waiting to be reborn. What is wrong baout America will be revisisted and retold.
America, founded on a rock, will always represent freedom to humanity.
Have no fear, American people, we are all God's sons and daughters, and there's a new day under the Sun.
What's great about America remains great. 
What needs to be known about America will be known.
The dross of the country will be removed, and the gold of the country will be refined and come to the surface.
There's newness for the country coming to life.
There's grace, equity, equality, and justice for today.
The governors represent the people, all the people.
Nothing is lost, nothing about America's roots are being displaced.
Everyone in the country belongs - all races, all creeds, all cultures, all religions.
America, a melting pot.
We were and can all be immigrants made new, we were and can all be explorers of the new earth, we were and can all be settlers finding our place to rest and be at peace, we were and can all be freedom-finders, no matter our background.
Americans, tied to the land, has a new day in the Sun.
The land belongs to everyone.
America is not at the center, but represents freedom-finding, for all ethnic backgrounds and races.

## Constant Evolution ##
There is a constant story of being, evolution of thought, revolution of light, rebirthing of man, and renewal of color.

## Social Media Usage ##
Why look her, or him up one more time? 
Lurking on social media; why lurk behind the scenes again?
I put a stop to the lurking, and control my usage.
I even delete the application on my own, and seek new online applications.

The images are beautiful; I am receiving Christmas Cards all years.
It's a place to express love, and appreciation, and meet people from a distance.
It's a place to see the beauty, and childlike grace, and innocence expressed in everyone.
People express joy in amazing ways and share that with everyone online.

But why open up so much to strangers from a distance?
Use wisdom, carefulness, and caution. Don't be someone from the outside looking in through the window you should not look through.

Be someone on the inside, being safe, being a friend to those you know.
Share photos like a Christmas Card, but limit the usage to those you know.

## What is My Motive? ##
To love someone new today.
To move beyond my comfort zone.
To include all of humanity in prayer.
To understand someone who needs help.
To express patience in my thought.
To see from a different angle.
To shift a habit.
To demonstrate order and cleanliness.

## Race - Why Do We Talk about Race? Why Do We Not Talk About Race? ##
What is race? A group or category of people. There are individuals within the group or the category. People tend to rank individuals within the group or the category. Race is not the only way to rank or group.
Why do I talk about race? To understand how someone perceives the world, to understand someone's cultural background, to appreciate the beauty of race, to understand someone in a different group.
Why do I not talk about race? To respect boundaries, to talk about more elevated ideas above the physique.

**A Poem on Healing**
The feeling of healing is being restored to one's true self, what's already there, and what's waiting to be born and discovered.
Dependent solely on the movement of God's love and God's word that speaks through intuition.
The real, substantive thoughts already lay hidden behind the surface of false beliefs.
The golden reality within is waiting to be awakened, unearthed, unhidden, and mined.
One's wholeness is innate, in tact, and always there.

## The American Chain [Written in 2010] ##
As a child, I grew up singing 'I am proud to be an American' like many of my peers. I never knew what it meant to be an American though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race. As Crevecoeur explains Americans, "we have no princes for hom we toil, starve, and bleed...Here man is free as he ought to be, nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are'. The American country gives a sense of opportunity to every unique individual. The American people volunteer their time to help other American people. If these characteristics of America are not fully true, they are a common goal for what our country will become; we continue to work towards these goals constantly. Lazarus illustrates that America welcomes even the "tired", the "poor", and the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" (11-12, 329).

A little over a year ago, in February 2008, I was at the Barack Obama rally where 18,000 people attended. When Obama began his speech the responses from everyone in the audience gave a feel of community support. Everyone was there for a common rreason; to support Obama, to support the Democrats, and most of all to support the United States of America. I felt love from each person standing near me. Everyone stood in a tight place, for over two hours, but I heard no complaints; everyone worked together to make the rally successful.

I had a similar experience in October 2008 when I went to another Barack Obama rally at the Tides' Stadium one week before the election. This event strengthened my love of being present in a community of Americans. Everyone had to behave and work together in the thirty degree weather to make the rally successful. Once again, each person I saw expressed friendliness and happiness. People stood in line patiently for hours before entering the stadium. Friends and neighbors helped each other when rushing through security. Volunteers gave their time to guide people to open seats.

Finally, in January 2009, on the Inaugaration Day, although I was not there, I watched the big event on television. As I watched the millions of people there, I could feel the preesnce of a true society. That day was truly a day full of nonpartisanship and support for America from everyone. Everyone supported Barack Obama on this day, a day of uniting America together. I not only truly felt like an American on that special day, but I also loved being an American. I wanted to make a difference for my country.

Throughout Obama's campaign and these three events, because I have grown love my country and understand the meaning of America, I have challenged myself to give back to this society. I decided to go to Monroe Elementary on Tuesday and Thrusday afternoons when I did not have activities after school. I help children who do not have the same privileges in their households with their homework through the "Homework Help" program. I do this with the Park Place Childlife Center. The children may not be able to read as well, or make as good grades as other children their age, but they all have such big hearts and love for people in general. The children all suppport each other and push each other to do their homework. The relationships between the students and my relationships to the students represent the American culture.

Because of the three events during Barack Obama's campaign and inauguration, I have realized the good of the American people, and I have learned the importance of giving back to my country. I can now declare that I understand the meaning of America. Through storm or shine, our country can fight its challenges with the help of each individual. Each individual is like a link in the chain. Each individual can also be represented as a bead in Dillard's notion where "each bead is transparent and each has a world, or the same world, light and alive and apparent inside the drop" (577). Each individual, despite his class, race, or gender matters. Each individual can contribute something to our society. Each individual ahs the opportunity to grow if he learns to work hard. If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

In her internet journal entitled 'Teaching Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn published in July of 1995, Shelley Fisher Fishkin argues that students should study the novel because it can make a difference in addressing the issues of racism. By making opinions and providing examples for them, she develops her argument. Fishkin describes the difference the novel can make when taught correctly in order to make the novel have a bigger impact. She encourages educators to teach the irony and satire Tain uses through a serious and urging tone.

Gregory ROberts, the writer of the internet journal, "'Huck Finn' a msterpiece - or an insul', published on November 26, 3003, suggests the importance of teaching *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* in high schools. He makes this suggestion clear by providing research and quotes from other sources. He presents research from both sides of the argument in order to give the correct view of the issue. Roberts uses a formal tone as he presents information to the general public.

Eugenia Harris asserts that *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* teaches us about American culture and we should thus continue to teach it in internet article "'Huck Finn' still pushes buttons, professor says', pbulished on September 26, 2000. Harris develops her assertion trhough using research and arguing against the opinions of others. She explains that books that have challenging content cause discussion and allow people to grow up in order to persuade readers of the importance of reading *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. Using a critical and assertive tone, Harris intends to convince the general public the importance of teaching the novel.

## Analysis of Frederick Douglass ##
If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to **deepen** my **conviction** of the **infernal** character of slavery, and to fill me with **unutterable loathing** of slaveholders, it was their **base ingratitude** to my poor old grandmother. She had served my old master **faithfully** from youth to old age. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his service. She had **rocked** him in **infancy**, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brown the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was neverhtless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided like so many **sheep**, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single wood, as to their or her own destiny. And, to the cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendship barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having **outlived** my old master and all his children, having seen the **beginning** and **end** of **all** of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already **racked** with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in eprfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die!

The hearth is **desolate**. The children, the **unconscious children**, who **once sang** and **danced** in her presence, are gone. She **gropes** her way, in the **darkness** of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the **voices of her children**, she hears by day **the moans of the dove**, and by night **the screams of the hideous owl**. All is **gloom**. The grave is at the door. And now, when **weighed down** by the pains and ahces of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the **beginning and ending of human existence most needful time**, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can existence meet**, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at the time, this **most needful time**, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection whichc hildren only can exercise towards a declining parent--my poor old grandmother, the **devoted mother** of twelve children, is left all **alone**, in younder little hut, before a few **dim** embers. She stands-- she sits--she **staggers**--she **falls**-she **groans**-she dies--and there are **none** of her children or grandchildren **present**, to **wipe** from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteous God visit for these things?

## The New President of the United States of America ##
Three months ago, fellow Americans elected a new President of the United States. THree weeks ago, hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans gathered to support the inaugration of a new President of the United States. Millions of Americans show excitement for their new President of the United States. Millions of Americans show excitement for their new President of the United States because having had a Black father and a White mother, he truly represents the American people.

Now we have many great tasks at hand must have determination in order to create peace as a unified nation. THe importance of continuing the equality and liberty for all Americans still remains present. We are involved in a global struggle on terror and many wars. We also have both an energy crisis and an economic crisis rising. Obama, representing everyone, is in touch with all Americans; we cna take advantage of this strength of his to improve our country. As a unified nation, regardless to our religion, ethnic background, or gender, we can invest in these responsibilities with a loving heart and empathy to mankind.

Now that President Barack Obama has stepped into the White House, we must continue to strive for a better America by showing determination in our lives and by supporting our new president. Because an African American has become President, it could cause Americans to forget our need for equality among all people. We cannot overlook the importance of this liberty that our fathers based the founding of the United States of America. We must strive for the change our president plans by working to our best potential on a daily basis. We cannot live with nice luxuries if our country as a whole is not committed to working hard. Finally, with the goal of creating peace, we must express helpfulness, empathy, and compassion to all. America can change for the better with President Barack Obama's help.

## Whitman and Dickinson ##
Both Whitman and Dickinson use their poetry as a device to explore themselves as an individual through a personal tone. They guide the reader into their personal piece of work by beginning i the 1st person. To open his poem, Whitman writes 'I celebrate myself', a phrase that contains two words that signify the self. Dickinson continues to write about himself as he uses the word 'I' seven times throughout his poem. Similarly, Dickinson writes 'I'm Nobody!' and uses the contraction of 'I am' to inform the reader that hse is going to explore herself. Whitman and Dickinson both compare themselves to others explaining either the difference or similarity of how other people in society view their selves. Whitman uses the line 'what I shall assume you shall assume' which emphasizes 'I' and 'you' to represent equlaity amongst humanity. He then continues 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you' which not only again emphasizes 'me' and 'you', but also emphasizes the word 'good'; Whitman portrays his realization that he is a unique and 'good' individual, and he reassures others that they are unique and good individuals as well. Dickinson relates herself to others as well by devoting her first paragraph to how she feels as a 'nobody' and her second paragraph to explain how others are 'somebodys'. Whitman and Dickinson both describe how they feel about themselves through literary devices; both poets use the device, connotation. Whitman portrays himself as calm and free when he writes that he is at ease watching 'summer grass'; the imagery of 'summer grass' suggests grass moving with the wind on a relaxing summer day. Dickinson also uses connotation when she explains herself as a 'nobody' and others as 'somebodys'. In the way she utilizes 'somebody', she gives the connotation of an important and popular person, and in the way she utilizes 'nobody', she gives the connotation of unimportant and unrecognized person.

While both poets explorer themsleves in their poems, Whitman's view on himself differs from Dickinson's view of herself. This is not only shown through their word choice, but also through their syntax, meter, and tone. By giving a celebratory tone in his opening, 'I celebrate myself, and sing myself', he shows that reader his content with himself. He continues to give a sense of pride and freedom when he writes, 'I loafe and invite my soul'; he feels confident with letting his soul free. Dickinson, on the other hand, represents a negative tone when she exclaims that she is a 'Nobody!'; she does not yet feel content with herself as a unique individual. Unlike Whitman's expressing a friendly tone when he reassures the reader that 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to [him]', Dickinson gives a critical tone exclaiming 'how dreary - to be Somebody!' Dickinson also expresses jealousy when she uses this critical tone; often one is jealous of the quality he is critical of. Through their differing styles, they also show their view of their self. Whitman's poetry has no meter but forms rhythm through his lists and wording; by doing this, he uses a free and extensive style, representing his confident self. Dickinson on the other hand, protrays dissatisfaction with the self by using a restrictive style with iambic meter and a more restrained pattern in the number of syllables. The syntax of each poet shows how he veiws the self as well. Whitman utilizes an idiom and a longer, more detailed phrase, 'Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same'. By writing long, detailed phrases like this one, he portraying an extensive and free self. Unlike Whitman, Dickinson writes simpler sentence and shorter lines. In one of ehr longest lines of eight syllables, she writes a two word sentence and a four word sentence, 'Don't tell! they'd advertise-you know!' Dickinson shows a restrictive self."

## Whitman and Dickinson ##
Walt Whitman, a poet who wrote in a unique style without boundaries, first published *Leaves of Grass* in 1855. It did not become 'Song of Myself' until 1881, and an 1892 edition was later published. Between the publications of *Leaves of Grass* in 1855. It did not become 'Song of Myself' until 1881, and an 1892 edition was later published. Between the publications of *Leaves of Grass* and 'Song of Myself', Whitman made many revisions to his poetry. Emily Dickinson, another poet from the nineteenth century, wrote works that served as a change in the literature in her time period. She first began writing poetry seriously in 1858, and seh continued her writing until death. She did not title her poetry, but her poem beginning, 'I'm Nobody!' dates to the approximate year, 1861. Like Whitman's 'Canto 1' which explores 'the self', Dickinson's 'I'm Nobody!' also explores 'the self'. Whitman and Dickinson are similar in that they use the first person to present a personal tone, but these poets differ in their styles of syntax, meter, and tone in order to force us to contemplate their views on the self.

Both Whitman and Dicksinon use their poetry as a device to explore themselves as individuals through a personal tone. They guide the reader into their personal piece of work by beginning in the 1st person. To open his poem, Whitman writes 'I celebrate myself', a phrase that contains two words that signify the self (line 1, WHitman). Dickinson continues to write about himself as he uses the word 'I' seven times throughout his poem. Similarly, Dickinson writes 'I'm Nobody!' and uses the contraction of 'I am' to inform the reader that she writes an exploratory poem (line 1, Dickinson). Whitman and Dickinson both compare themselves to others by explaining either the difference or similarity of how other people in society view their selves. Whitman uses the line 'what I shall assume you shall assume' which emphasizes 'I' and 'you' to represent equlaity amongst humanity (line 2, Whitman). He then continues 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you' which again emphasizes the self and the reader but it Whitman portrays his realization that he is a unique and 'good' individual, and he reassures others that they are unique and good individuals as well when he emphasizes the word 'good' (line 3, Whitman). Like Whitman, Dickinson relates herself to others by devoting her first stanza to how she feels as a 'nobody' and her second stanza to explain how others are 'somebodys'.

While both poets explore themselves in their poems, Whitman's view on himself differs from Dickinson's view of herself; they reveal their view of themselves not only through their word choice, but also through their syntax, meter, and tone. By giving a celebratory tone in his opening. 'I celebrate myself, and sing myself', Whitman describes his satisfaction as an individual to the reader (line 1, Whitman). He continues to give a sense of pride and freedom when he writes, 'I loafe and invite my soul'; he feels confident in letting his soul free (line 4, Whitman). Dickinson, on the other hand, represents a negative tone when she exclaims taht she '[is] a Nobody!'; she does not yet feel content with herself as a unique indidvidual (line 1, Dickinson). Unlike Whitman's expressing a friendly tone when he reassures the reader that 'every atom belonging to me as good belongs to [him]', Dickinson exclaims, 'how dreary - to be - Somebody!', giving a critical tone (line 5, Dickinson). By using dashes to split up her sentence, Dickinson also expresses jealousy when she uses this critical tone. Through their differing styles, they also show their view of their self. Whitman's poetry has no meter but forms rhythm through his lists and wording. Using the seventeen-syllable phrase that contains rhythm, 'I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard', Whitman uses a free and extensive style, representing his confident self (line 11, Whitman). Whitman also utilizes an idiom and a longer, more detailed phrase, 'Born here of parents born here from parents the same' (line 7, Whitman). By writing long, detailed phrases liek this one, he portrays an extensive and free self. Dickinson, however, portrays dissatisfaction with the self by using a restrictive style with iambic meter and a more restrained pattern in the number of syllables. Dickinson writes simpler sentences and shorter lines with six-eight syllables. In one of her longest lines of eight syllables, she writes two sentences - a two-word sentence and a four-word sentence, 'Don't tell! they'd adertise-you know!', DIckinson reveals a dissatisifed and restrained self (line 6, Dickinson).

As the two poets, Whitman and Dickinson went through life writing poetry and exploring themselves, it led to the publications of poetry about the self. Although they both search and discover about the self in their poems, their different mehtods including Whitman's extensive style and Dickinson's restrictive style reflect the overall philosophy and personality of the poets. Extending recognition to all individuals, Whitman grew up interested in the 'One existing throughout the Many' and promoted both himself and all unique persons in society. Dickinson's growing up as a reclusive and skeptical woman can explain her style and tone in 'I'm Nobody!'. Because Whitman and Dickinson ahve different personal beliefs, they utilize different methods, and styles which reflect their selves.

## "The New Colossus" ##
"It is not like the impudent and bold giant of Greek fame
Who conquers many lands with strength;
On our newly found and open gates shall stand 
A mighty and brave woman holding a torch
With confined flames, and her name is
The Mother of Exiles. From her guiding and fixed hand
She gives a world-wide welcome; her gentle eyes direct
That this harbor frames.
'Continue to display the important stories of your old lands!'
SHe cries with a shut mouth. 'I welcome your country's 
Poor and hardworking, your people that desire freedom,
And the unaccepted of yoru land.
These homeless people shall be sent to me,
For I use my lamp to guide them through!'"

## Chaucer, History of the English Language ##
"Experience, though noon auctoritee
Were int his world, is right ynogh for me
To speke of wo that is in mariage;
For, lordynges, sith I twelve yeer was of age,
Thonked be God that is eterne on lyve,
Housbondes at chirche dore I have had fyve,--
If I so ofte myghte have ywedded bee,--
And alle were worthy men in hir degree.
But me was toold, certeyn, nat longe agoon is,
That sith that Crist ne wente nevere but onis
To weddyng, in the Cane of Galilee,
That by the same ensample taughte he me
That I ne sholde wedded be but ones."

## Georg Puttenham, The Arte of English Poetie ##
"But after a speach is fully fashioned to the common understanding, & accepted by consent of a whole countrey & natio, it is called a language, & receaueth none allowed alteration, but by extraordinary occasions by little & little, as it were insensibly bringing in of many corruptios that creepe along with the time: of all which matters, we haue more largely spoken in our bookes of the originals and pedigree of the English tong. Then when I lay language, I meane the speach wherein the Poet or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine or as our case is the vulgar English, & when it is peculiar unto a countrey it is called the moter speach of that people: the Greekes terme it Idioma; for is ours at this day the Norman English. Before the Conquest of the Normans it was the ANglesaxon and before that the British, which as some will, is at this day, the Walsh, or as others affirme the Cornish: I for my part thinke neither of both, as they be now spoken and p<r>onounced. This part in our maker or Poet must be heedyly looked unto that it be naturall, pure, and the most usuall of all his countrey: and for the same purpose rather that which is spoken in the kings Court, or in teh good townes and Cities within the land, then in the marches and frontiers, or in port townes, where straungers haunt for traffike fake, or yet in Universities where Schollers use much peeuish affectation of words out of the primatiue languages, or finally, in any uplandish village or corner of a Realme, where is no resort but of poore rusticall or unciuill people: neither shall he follow the speach of a craftes man or carter, or other of the inferiour ofrt, though he be inhabitant or bred in the best towne and Citie in this Realme, for such persons doe abuse good speaches by strange accents or ill shapen foundes, and false ortographie. But he shall follow generally the better brough up fort, such as the Greeks call [charientes] men ciuill and graciously behauored and bred. Our maker therefore at these days shalll not follow..."

## **I am not a naturally verbal thinker. I am more naturally a visual thinker, and it has taken me a long time in life to learn how to express my feelings in a world where expressing feelings, or opening up is not ok. I have turned to writing poetry with Picadilly products, and I explore how poetic thinking supports systems engineering. Earlier in 2020, and before 2020, I was sending aggressive emails, but my sister realized that some of my attacks had a poetic sound underlying them. Some people don't feel like expressing feelings is ok, and that feelings must be worked out independently; but feelings must be expressed, others express feelings through music, and poetry is a good tool for expressing feelings verbally. I write two poems each day.** ##

## 2020 -  Pivotal Year - A Draft ##
It's intuitively known to man that man is coexistent with God in one grand brotherhood that has the freedom to sing and soar far above the clouds.
Do I choose to live together with others in human strife, or do I harmonize with people?
This determines whether I, we truly can sing and soar, and this depends on my tone of heart, mind, conversation, song, and ears.

The first grand spiritual lessons I learned were to feel the love from my mom while doing homework, understand the lives of African Americans while watching 'Eyes on the Prize' with my dad, appreciate diversity in the human race, treat an enemy like a cousin or a brother, 'speaking gently to the harsh words', truly love the ex-girlfriend of an enemy rather than feel intimitaed by or compared to with her, love the kindred spirit of a guy I felt I liked on social media, and rally hear what the Holy Spirit, not human opinion, communicates about man.

There have been times when I've expressed humility when meeting President Obama and visited the White House to 'hack the gender pay gap'. And unfortunately there have been times when I have melted down, attacked people through horrible communication and threatened to kill people in ways that sound like President Donald Trump has sometimes sounded out of fear, envy, or pride.

Song on Pangea, President Obama Election, I Believe

The time finally came for me to choose, like a nation does, whether I turn to the light or to the shadow. Can I put downt he civil war sword of my grandfather's monstrous rage And the gun images I had sent?

We all dwell in the Shadow of the Almighty at all times whether we know it or not. But do I choose to make my bed in fear, envy, a sense of inferiority, physical pain, discouragement, anger, rage, self-justification, gun violence, self-mutilation, and hell? Or do I choose to make my bed in heaven? God will always be there behind the clouds of mortal sense like the Sun does, moving our receptive hearts and minsd always in the right direction, but moment by moment, I have the ability to choose where I make my bed. Psalm 23:4 'Yea, though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me' represents this spiritual concept.

My mom worked as a teacher like my grandmother did. And as a mom, she exuded so much motherly love when she helped us with our homework. I used to feel like I wanted to teach and educate with that much love and joy of learning that she and my grandmother expressed. I remember my mom discouraging me from teaching because in their experience there weren't enough men teaching, and I remember feeling a constant mortal sene that I was dependent on men or desperate to be in a relationship with a guy.

...

## A Draft That I Don't Like...Something to Toss Out ##
"I denied that the music was for me, and prayed that there was another woman the song was for.
I felt for him, and loved his heart, but felt guilt, rejected, and ignored, and ashamed, and I grew stronger.
I felt ignored, and I wished him well, and encouraged him to move in another direction, and pushed him away.
He broke away, and I trusted he was led to something better. 
When seeing more deeply, I realized he was a cowboy, a real cowboy, and saw more innocence in the cowboy hat.
When listening more deeply, it reminded me of my high school friend, and woke me up to how he viewed the world in a clearer light.
I saw the beauty of the Medieval English country, and true chivalry, where women and men are equal.
I fell down hard to the ground, learned some life lessons, and the Black man from the South saved my life with good cheer, good faith, and a good conversation.
I had already felt eternity once, but I felt eternity for the whole country, all the people, and the touch of eternity I felt in my darkest hours.
You can let this go, darling, your good, Southern uncles and aunts already calls you darling.
So do not worry child, heaven has got a plan for you, always.
You are a true Southerner, indeed, who is admitting to your wrongs, and seeking to understand and be better."

# Writing from Grade School #
## Dwight David Eisenhower ##
There was once a boy who was visiting his relatives and was outside playing when he saw a bird missing. The bird was about to attack him. This boy was Dwight David Eisenhower. He didn't only like to attack as an adult in his career as a leader in the army but also as a child. Eisenhower was born in Kansas in 1890. He married Mamie Doud on July 1, 1960 in Denver, Colorado.

At first, Eisenhower wasn't planning on going to college until after his brother went for two years. Then he found out about West Point giving scholarships. Eisenhower wasn't sure about being a soldier. He decided to go and afterwards he came back wanting to be a soldier. He didn't know what his parents would say, but they ended up letting him.

Eisenhower went to West Point for college to traint o be in the Army. he wa a planner of D-Day which took pace on June 6, 1944. D-Day was a very successful battle. Eisenhower was also the thirty-fourth president of the United States. However, eh was forced into the presidency rather than choosing to be president. He served as president for two terms. Eisenhower died from a series of strokes on March 28, 1969.

Many people saw Eisenhower as a great leader. He became such a great leader through three special qualties during the presidency and while he was in the army. he was hard-working, creative, and popular.

One of these qualities is that he was hard-working and Eisenhower demonstrated hard-working in many ways. One of these ways was when he was at West Point, it was very hard. West Point was hard in a few ways. It was very strict and there was constant exercise. The drills were also hard, for example they made you have your chin back, your head up, your shoulders back, and run a lot! Even though it was hard and 285 students dropped out, Eisenhower didn't. Even though the work was hard, he kept on going. He even passed sixty- first from the top which wasn't the best but means he passed. Another way he demonstrated his hard work is that even if he didn't enjoy what he was supposed to do, he would do it anyways. An example of this is when he had to train other soldiers' routines. He didn't really favor doing this but he did it anyways. He also showed his skill of hard- working by when he was in the Army in Europe. He worked so well there, that people treated Eisenhower as though he beat Hitler himself. There was a time in his life when he was worried about money. To solve this problem he kept on working as well as he could. Eisenhower admired George Washington. George Washington was a great leader as well. This is probably why he was such a hard worker.

Eisenhower was creative as well as being hard- working. There are also many examples of Eisenhower being creative. One of them is that he is good at organizing. You have to be creative to be a good organizer. Eisenhower put together units for war. This was one of his first jobs in the army. Another way Eisenhower showed his creativity was when he wrote a book about being in war. This book became a top seller. Eisenhower also planned D-Day. When planning, he was very nervous, but it turned out very well. D-Day took place in Normandy, France and the Allies won. At the end of Eisenhower's life, he wrote three books abou his experience of being in the Army.

Eisenhower's top military job was being a General. He was general during World War II. He was a big part in D-Day. He was a commander on D-Day. It was supposed to be in May but there were a few technical problems, so it got postponed to June. Eisenhower said that it was postponed to June 5th, but then, they found out that there would be bad weather which would make irplane landing very dangerous. Eisenhower decided to delay it by a day. He was very worried but on D-Day they ended up doing very well. Later, Germany surrendered on May 7th 1945.

One other important quality helped Eisenhower's success. This was popularity. He was very popular throughout the country during his career. He was also popular as a child when Eisenhower was a young boy in school, he was really popular. He even had this popularity at school when his family was poor and couldn't pay for nice clothing. He was so popular that he became President of Abilene High School Athletic Association when he was in high school. People called Eisenhower 'Ike' there and everywhere else too. ANother example of popularity was that when he got back from Europe, he did so well that he was treated as though he killed Hitler himself. After he got back, he flew to England to go to a ceremony. The ceremony took place in London and he was invited by Winston Churchill. At the ceremony he received a key and he made a speech of acceptance, 'I am not a native of this land. I come from the very heart of America...' Another way that showed Eisenhower's populrarity is that he didn't really want to be president although he became president and served for two terms. He was forced into presidency because so many people wanted him to be president. He was successful as president. He helped the civil rights movement and helped blacks. One way is that he helped Ruby Bridges be able to safely be at an all white school. He made a difference in America by being president. He was forced into presidency because of his popularity and he was popular in numerous ways.

Eisenhower was a fantastic leader. He wouldn't have become this great leader without being hard-working, creative, and popular. Eisenhower helped a lot in World War II. He helped end the war in victory for the Allies. As president, he was against discrimination. In Eisenhower's first inaugural address, he says 'The men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn- all serve proudly, and as profitably for America as the statemen who draft treaties and the legislator who enact laws.' Eisenhower was also a man who strived for world peace. He strived for world peace by two ways. One of the ways was by not wanting war. He tried to end the Korean War while president. He also wanted people to be equal and wanted people to help other people out. Eisenhower fulfilled many of his dreams and made a difference in the United States of America and in how our country is today."
## Popularity ##
Popularity to me can be good or bad. It depends on who you are. If you were popular then I would say yes. If you weren't so popular I would say no because then those people sort of have to suffer. No matter whether you are popular or not you should always be nice to others. The dangers of popularity is that people get left out. Also, sometimes peopel who are very, very nice are unpopular when you think that they could be popular for how nice they are. I really, truly could go either way though.

## Competitiveness ##
I think competitiveness is away to see whether you have improved. You can compete with yourself or against others. I like to compete. I use both ways. I feel that competitivenes is important. An example of me competing is in swimming. During swim practice, I compete against myself in seeing if my strokes are less than before and if the way I swim looks better.
