## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
<br> with a heart yearning to express itself.
<br>
<br> In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
<br> with ivory yearning to be tickled.
<br>
<br>'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
<br> with stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
<br> and in return she receives a great gift.
<br>
<br>Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
<br> Her eyes no longer shed tears.
<br> Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
<br> Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
<br> Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
<br> Her heart has found freedom.
<br> And her mind has found relief.
<br>
<br> She is now content
<br> with the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing music on the keys,
she discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

<br>

## What Can America Achieve? ##
Despair, 
<br> enormous, steep,
<br> scorching, perishing, callousing,
<br> The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
<br> overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
<br> bright, energetic,
<br> Hope.

<br>

## From the Past to the Future ##
Past,
<br> fond, sentimental,
<br> remembering, romanticizing, reminiscing,
<br> Letting go of the old to reign in the new - 
<br> hoping, expecting, anticipating,
<br> promising, optimistic,
<br> Future.

<br> 

## A New Day ##
It's a new day for the sun to shine.
<br> Wake up, and be free. The day is yours, and the day is mine.

It's a really great day for the sky to be blue.
<br> Look up high! And see the birds soaring too!

On this new day the birds really sing.
<br> It's fun to sing with the birds and hear their songs ringaling.

It's a new day for the earth to move.
<br> It's amazing how all the people really get into a groove.

On this new day I've got two feet on the ground.
<br> It's love that makes the world go around.

It's a really great day to go out and seize the day.
<br> Neighbors wave, and people laugh and play.

It's a new day to run and skip outside.
<br> It's more wonderful to do this with friends by my side.

On this new day I wear a smile on my face.
<br> I do all that I need to do with a heart filled with grace.

<br>

## How Will I Best Use the Moment? ##
How will I best use the moment?
<br> Will I pray?….or will I vent?

Will I think about all that’s going on?
<br> Or will I think about all that’s going wrong?

I must say that life is more joyous when I pray.
<br> And living in gratitude for God is the way.

So I will make the most of each minute, each day.
<br> I will remember to love and thank God always.

And I will find a way to help someone somewhere.
<br> I will turn to God to help me show some care.

<br> 

## God's Grand Story ##
For your life, eternally to God be the glory.
<br> So let Him conceive of and write your whole story.

Your story He’s been writing since the beginning of time.
<br> He’s been thinking you up as someone loved and divine.

This story never ends; it’s always unfolding.
<br> In His eyes you’re amazing; your character he’s molding.

There’s never been a minute when you’ve been separated from Him.
<br> God has not created you without thought on a whim.

Yes, sometimes mortal lies sure do like to creep in.
<br> Like “I’m lacking, I’ve been fired, or I’m full of sin!”.

But God can reveal a world full of His plans.
<br> For in reality everything is ordered in His hands.

So choose to see you in the way God sees you.
<br> Be part of what He’s crafting with the grand view.

<br> 

## The Bookseller ##
Every morning, she comes to work at eight,
<br> ready to make the day in the bookstore great.

Helping people find books is what she does,
<br> with knowledge of what topics are keeping the world abuzz.

After sharing a smile with each customer who walks in,
<br> she helps people find stories to begin and then end.

She also sorts and shelves thousands of books,
<br> making sure not to disturb people hiding in nooks.

Checking people out, she takes cash and cards with care,
<br> so that people can take home something to read in a chair.

And at the end of the day, she locks up the place,
<br> making sure no one can break into the special space.

<br>

## The Barista ##
Every morning, he comes to work right at six,
<br> ready to fill each person's unique coffee fix.

Day in and day out, he works all day long, 
<br> making each drink, in the rhythm of a cheerful song.

As each customer comes up to the cash register,
<br> he makes each one glad for their expenditure.

Good conversations with each customer he sparks,
<br> especially when a complicated order is barked.

He remembers each coffee drink's recipe by heart,
<br> crafting each drink like he would a work of art.

And at the end of the day he cleans up the store,
<br> preparing it for tomorrow, when he walks again through the door.

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 1 ##
One night, Gabby complained to mama, "I had a terrible day today".
<br> Gabby then said, "nothing at all went my way!"

Mama responded, "that's ok" but encouraged Gabby to have an attitude of gratitude.
<br> "But be thankful", she told Gabby, "because that will help you have a joyful mood!"

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings.
<br> And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright.
<br> And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

"There's so much", Gabby said, "to be grateful for!"
<br> "I am going to think of more and more and more!"

"I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend.
<br> The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

I am grateful for my teacher who teaches us how to read.
<br> Today we read a book by Jory John, which is called 'The Bad Seed'.

I am grateful for the lunch server who always smiles at my classmates and me.
<br> She's always wearing a pretty bracelet that says 'Be Free'.

I am grateful for recess when we went to the playground.
<br> Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school.
<br> Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for the spaghetti my brother and I ate for dinner.
<br> The pasta was so good because it was thinner."

Then Gabby said, "Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer.
<br> Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is indeed the answer!"

"Good job on being grateful", said mama. "This list is yours to keep.
<br> And now that you've developed this list, you can sweetly sleep".

"Good night", said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss.
<br> "Tomorrow night I will share another list."

<br>

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 2 ##
Every night Gabby snuggled in bed with mama. 
<br> And every night Gabby and mama talked about how the day went in their pajamas. 

One night before bedtime, Gabby complained to mama, “I had a terrible day today”. 
<br> Gabby then said, “nothing at all went my way!”

“I’m so sorry”, said mama, “what happened?
<br> What has made you feel so saddened and maddened?”

“I forgot to set my alarm clock last night,” said Gabby, “and that led me to miss the bus.
<br> Then, when I got to school late, my teacher made a big fuss. 

When we had coloring time I did not get to use my favorite crayon. 
<br> When I looked in the box for my favorite purple one it was gone. 

Someone in my class spilled juice on me, and it got on my shirt. 
<br> Unfortunately it also stained my new skirt!

There was a leak in the roof, and I got wet.
<br> Getting wet made me feel so upset. 

At recess, while running and playing tag, I slipped. 
<br> Because I fell on the ground, my t-shirt ripped.

And tonight for dinner we ate a disgusting meal. 
<br> It was a grownup dish that had in it salmon and eel.” 

Mama responded, “I understand. That all sounds terrible.
<br> I’m sure right now life feels really unbearable.”

“But,” mama said “I encourage you to keep an attitude of gratitude.
<br> Being thankful will help you stay in a joyful mood!

You can pay attention to all the good things that happen too. 
<br> And when you think of these things, you won’t feel as blue.”

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings. 
<br> And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright. 
<br> And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

“There’s so much”, Gabby said, “to be grateful for!
<br> I am going to think of more and more and more!

I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend. 
<br> The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

I am grateful for my teacher who teaches us how to read.

<br> Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school. 
<br> Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for my brother’s and my dinner, which was macaroni and cheese. 
<br> I even tried the vegetables my dad made and liked the peas.”

Then Gabby said, “Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer. 
<br> Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is the answer!”

“Sometimes life does not always go my way.
<br> But if I remember the good things that happen, it brightens the day.”

“Good job on being grateful”, said mama. “This list is yours to keep. 
<br> And now that you’ve developed this list, you can sweetly sleep”.

“Good night”, said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss. 
<br> “Tomorrow night I will share another list.”

## A World Filled with Love - version 2 ##
A mailman takes letters to each house in town. 
<br> While walking he smiles at a woman with a frown. 

The woman then began to smile too. 
<br> When she got home she made her sick neighbor some stew. 

When eating the stew the neighbor began to feel better. 
<br> When she got out of bed she knitted her friend a sweater. 

The friend loved feeling cozy and warm. 
<br> To give back, she provided shelter to a family caught in a storm. 

The family was grateful that they had a place to stay dry. 
<br> While in shelter the family made their teacher a pie. 

The teacher was happy to have a sweet treat to eat. 
<br> She gave out clothes to people in need on the street. 

The people were glad to have something to wear. 
<br> The people wrote thank you notes to a preacher with a prayer. 

The preacher rejoiced that people were thinking of him. 
<br> He rolled the wheelchair of a man with a broken limb. 

The man appreciated he could go to the park. 
<br> To another man there he shared a kind remark. 

The other man was delighted with what the man said. 
<br> The other man continued to share love, and throughout the town the love spread. 

So the lesson is that one small thing can lead to a world filled with love.
<br> For love is what we’re all truly born of.

## Good Going On Today #
I wake up and make the bed
<br> I make sure that I am fed 
<br> I put on my boots and walk out the door 
<br> I am ready to see what this day has in store 

I get in my car, and I put in the keys 
<br> I’ve got my window down, and I’m feeling the breeze 
<br> The radio is on; I’m listening to the news 
<br> There are stories of people creating new products to use  

I arrive at my workplace and walk in and say hello
<br> It’s a new day on the grind; this I know 
<br> So I turn on my laptop and I get to work 
<br> I put my mind on my projects and refuse to shirk

Someone comes over and invites me to lunch
<br> I say of course I’ll go and enjoy a munch 
<br> We talk about work and how the day is 
<br> The day is going well, gee-whiz 

In the pm I leave work and go for a walk
<br> I get on the phone with my mom for a talk 
<br> Outside I see someone doing a kind deed
<br> My grandma always said every kind deed is a little seed

After the walk I get home, and I rest 
<br> I remember all the good things that make me feel blessed 

Chorus: 
There’s good going on today, so why don’t I sing
<br> I am glad about all the things that the good Lord brings 
<br> The sun is shining, the birds are chirping 
<br> The world is moving,  the people are smiling 

<br> 

## Boots ##
These boots of mine that I love. They've really been everywhere. <br>
They've walked down many roads. <br>
They've dug their heels into the dirt. <br>
Can't you see? They've really been worn. <br>

These worn-down boots that I love. They've traveled the world. <br>
They've stepped on rocks. <br>
They've run through grass. <br>
Can't you see? They have some holes in the soles. <br>

These beloved boots are mine. They've been my best friend. <br>
They've gone down lonely pathways. <br>
They've skipped across sidewalks. <br>
Can't you see? They've become sturdy and strong. <br>

These wonderful boots that I love. I keep them tied real tight. <br>
They've kept me feeling snug. <br>
They're as comfortable as can be. <br>
Can't you see? They're my favorite. <br>

These boots of mine that I love. They've really gone the extra mile. <br>
They've done more than I could've asked for. <br>
They've survived the hard work. <br>
Can't you see? There's some pep in every step with them. <br>

<br>

Play some great music. <br>
Live. <br>
Really live. <br>

<br>

## I Am One in A Sea ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to say something kind.

I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.

I am a body in a sea of bodies learning to be free.

I am a heart in a sea of hearts seeking to love more.

I am a set of eyes in a sea of eyes looking to see the good.

The lone bird glides with the wind. <br>
The lone bird pecks at the lead.  <br>
The lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground. <br>

But not today <br>
Learning to leave it in yesterday <br>
