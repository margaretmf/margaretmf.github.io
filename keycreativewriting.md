## Through creative writing, I practice observation and use words thoughtfully. Check out my creative writing below. ##

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
<br> with a heart yearning to express itself.
<br>
<br> In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
<br> with ivory yearning to be tickled.
<br>
<br>'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
<br> with stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
<br> and in return she receives a great gift.
<br>
<br>Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
<br> Her eyes no longer shed tears.
<br> Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
<br> Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
<br> Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
<br> Her heart has found freedom.
<br> And her mind has found relief.
<br>
<br> She is now content
<br> with the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing music without words on the keys,
she discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

<br>

## What Can America Achieve? Diamante Poem ##
Despair,

The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
bright, energetic,
Hope.

## America Reborn ##
I once had a vision, or a dream of American reborn. I love that women are behind the rebirth of the American dream and that black men can lead the country well.
Women are behind the rebirth of the American dream through the work in the postal office and the elections. A sense of America reborn actually came a live in 2021, but this great American dream was alive all the time with all the people that have gone before expressing freedom, marching towards the light, overcoming, and freeing other people from bondage.

## The American Chain, Written in 2010 ##
As a child, I grew up singing "I Am Proud To Be an American" like many of my peers. I never knew what it mean to be an American though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race. As Crevecoeur explains Americans, "we have no princes for whom we toil, starve, and bleed...Here man is free as he ought to be, nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are". The American country gives a sense of opportunity to every unique individual. The American people volunteer their time to help other American people. If these characteristics of America are not fully true, they are a common goal for what our country will become; we continue to work towards these goals constantly. Lazarus illustrates that America welcomes even "the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free" (pp. 11-12, 329).

A little over a year ago, in February 2008, I was at the Barack Obama rally where 18,000 people attended. When Mr. Barack Obama began his speech, the responses from everyone in the audience gave a feel of community support. Everyone was there for a common reason: to support Mr. Obama, to support the Democrats, and most of all to support the United Sates of America. I felt love from each person standing near me. Everyone stood in a tight place for over two hours, but I heard no complaints; everyone worked together to make the rally successful.

I had a similar experience in October 2008 when I went to another Barack Obama rally at the Tides' Stadium one week before the election. This event strengthened my love of being present in a community of Americans. Everyone had to behave and work together in the thirty degree weather to make the rally successful. Once again, each person I saw expressed friendliness and happiness. People stood in line patiently for hours before entering the stadium. Friends and neighbors helped each other when rushing through security. Volunteers gave their time to guide people to open seats.

Finally, in January 2009, on the Inaugaration Day, although I was not there, I watched the big event on television. As I watched the millions of people there, I could feel the presence of a true society. That day was truly a day full of nonpartisanship and support for America from everyone. Everyone supported Barack Obama on this day, a day of uniting America together. I not only truly felt like an American on that special day, but I also loved being an American. I wanted to make a difference for my country.

Throughout Obama's campaign and these three events, because I have grown love for my country and understand the meaning of America, I have challenged myself to give back to this society. I decided to go to Monroe Elementary on Tuesday and Thrusday afternoons when I did not have activities after school. I help children who do not have the same privileges in their households with their homework through the *Homework Help* program. I do this with the Park Place Childlife Center. The children may not be able to read as well, or make as good grades as other children their age, but they all have such big hearts and love for people in general. The children all suppport each other and push each other to do their homework. The relationships between the students and my relationships to the students represent the American culture.

Because of the three events during Barack Obama's campaign and inauguration, I have realized the good of the American people, and I have learned the importance of giving back to my country. I can now declare that I understand the meaning of America. Through storm or shine, our country can fight its challenges with the help of each individual. Each individual is like a link in the chain. Each individual can also be represented as a bead in Dillard's notion where "each bead is transparent and each has a world, or the same world, light and alive and apparent inside the drop" (p. 577). Each individual, despite his class, race, or gender matters. Each individual can contribute something to our society. Each individual has the opportunity to grow if he learns to work hard. If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

## The American Chain, Edited in 2021 ##
As a child, I grew up singing "I Am proud to be an American" as many of my peers did. I did not know what it meant to be an American as deeply as recently though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race. As Crevecoeur explains Americans, "we have no princes for whom we toil, starve, and bleed...Here man is free as he ought to be, nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are."

If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

Since writing this, I have continued to see the meaning of America. When reading Vice President Kamala Harris's book, I saw how the words of Lazarus influence her work helping people in need as a political leader; and when watching the fourth of July festivities in Washington, DC I saw the huddle of Americans expressing cheer, renewal, and love for diversity. I hope to continue to stand witness to the meaning of America heading into the future.

## Exploring The Controversy ##
A flag is a sign, and a symbol. I can understand how people feel like the Confederate flag represents good things about Southern culture, Southern heritage, and the birth of the American Country. The people waving the Confederate flag or wearing Confederate symbols are not bad. They express joy, they express light-heartedness, they express innocence, they express a love of people, and they express a desire to learn, grow, and improve. The Civil War, however, was a war over an enslaved race, not just a war over land and economy. It offends people because it represents also dark things like slavery, Southern patriarchy, a false sense of dependency which leads to "benevolent racism, and benevolent sexism", and systemic violence and oppression. The traumatic memories of a past of enslavement have still come up, waiting to be shared to inform and educate people on what's not right in our country's past, and what's not right in human relations. Land and economy are part of the South, but land and economy expand to the North and the West.

## The Virginia Flag ##
The Virginia state flag is such a beautiful blue symbol, representing freedom from tyranny and the reign of Virtue, with signs for Liberty, Eternity, and Agriculture.

## Dwight David Eisenhower - Writing from Grade School ##
There was once a boy who was visiting his relatives and was outside playing when he saw a bird missing. The bird was about to attack him. This boy was Dwight David Eisenhower. He didn't only like to attack as an adult in his career as a leader in the army but also as a child. Eisenhower was born in Kansas in 1890. He married Mamie Doud on July 1, 1960 in Denver, Colorado.

At first, Eisenhower wasn't planning on going to college until after his brother went for two years. Then he found out about West Point giving scholarships. Eisenhower wasn't sure about being a soldier. He decided to go and afterwards he came back wanting to be a soldier. He didn't know what his parents would say, but they ended up letting him.

Eisenhower went to West Point for college to traint o be in the Army. he wa a planner of D-Day which took pace on June 6, 1944. D-Day was a very successful battle. Eisenhower was also the thirty-fourth president of the United States. However, eh was forced into the presidency rather than choosing to be president. He served as president for two terms. Eisenhower died from a series of strokes on March 28, 1969.

Many people saw Eisenhower as a great leader. He became such a great leader through three special qualties during the presidency and while he was in the army. he was hard-working, creative, and popular.

One of these qualities is that he was hard-working and Eisenhower demonstrated hard-working in many ways. One of these ways was when he was at West Point, it was very hard. West Point was hard in a few ways. It was very strict and there was constant exercise. The drills were also hard, for example they made you have your chin back, your head up, your shoulders back, and run a lot! Even though it was hard and 285 students dropped out, Eisenhower didn't. Even though the work was hard, he kept on going. He even passed sixty- first from the top which wasn't the best but means he passed. Another way he demonstrated his hard work is that even if he didn't enjoy what he was supposed to do, he would do it anyways. An example of this is when he had to train other soldiers' routines. He didn't really favor doing this but he did it anyways. He also showed his skill of hard- working by when he was in the Army in Europe. He worked so well there, that people treated Eisenhower as though he beat Hitler himself. There was a time in his life when he was worried about money. To solve this problem he kept on working as well as he could. Eisenhower admired George Washington. George Washington was a great leader as well. This is probably why he was such a hard worker.

Eisenhower was creative as well as being hard- working. There are also many examples of Eisenhower being creative. One of them is that he is good at organizing. You have to be creative to be a good organizer. Eisenhower put together units for war. This was one of his first jobs in the army. Another way Eisenhower showed his creativity was when he wrote a book about being in war. This book became a top seller. Eisenhower also planned D-Day. When planning, he was very nervous, but it turned out very well. D-Day took place in Normandy, France and the Allies won. At the end of Eisenhower's life, he wrote three books about his experience of being in the Army.

Eisenhower's top military job was being a General. He was general during World War II. He was a big part in D-Day. He was a commander on D-Day. It was supposed to be in May but there were a few technical problems, so it got postponed to June. Eisenhower said that it was postponed to June 5th, but then, they found out that there would be bad weather which would make irplane landing very dangerous. Eisenhower decided to delay it by a day. He was very worried but on D-Day they ended up doing very well. Later, Germany surrendered on May 7th 1945.

One other important quality helped Eisenhower's success. This was popularity. He was very popular throughout the country during his career. He was also popular as a child when Eisenhower was a young boy in school, he was really popular. He even had this popularity at school when his family was poor and couldn't pay for nice clothing. He was so popular that he became President of Abilene High School Athletic Association when he was in high school. People called Eisenhower *Ike* there and everywhere else too. ANother example of popularity was that when he got back from Europe, he did so well that he was treated as though he killed Hitler himself. After he got back, he flew to England to go to a ceremony. The ceremony took place in London and he was invited by Winston Churchill. At the ceremony he received a key and he made a speech of acceptance, *I am not a native of this land. I come from the very heart of America...'* Another way that showed Eisenhower's populrarity is that he didn't really want to be president although he became president and served for two terms. He was forced into presidency because so many people wanted him to be president. He was successful as president. He helped the civil rights movement and helped blacks. One way is that he helped Ruby Bridges be able to safely be at an all white school. He made a difference in America by being president. He was forced into presidency because of his popularity and he was popular in numerous ways.

Eisenhower was a fantastic leader. He wouldn't have become this great leader without being hard-working, creative, and popular. Eisenhower helped a lot in World War II. He helped end the war in victory for the Allies. As president, he was against discrimination. In Eisenhower's first inaugural address, he says, "The men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn- all serve proudly, and as profitably for America as the statemen who draft treaties and the legislator who enact laws." Eisenhower was also a man who strived for world peace. He strived for world peace by two ways. One of the ways was by not wanting war. He tried to end the Korean War while president. He also wanted people to be equal and wanted people to help other people out. Eisenhower fulfilled many of his dreams and made a difference in the United States of America and in how our country is today.

## The Democratic Republic and the Debate Inside My Head ##
Two parties of people govern the nation. Each party represents a set of ideas for how to represent the people, a set of philosophies for how to govern people with order, and a set of ways to handle collective challenges. No party has absolute control. The party in control has representative power over a set of people and over the collective whole. The party not in control also represents another set of people. The governmental structure builds in a space for dialogue, or a debate that gives room for disagreement that can yield to agreement. Not everyone has to agree, but everyone should point their thought to the greater good that supports the life, love, and soul that exists within people's hearts and minds. New ideas can evolve out of conflict and disagreement, leading to something better than before. A new nation is built everytime conflict erupts so destructively. A republic (government is a "public matter"): "a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch". The republic constitutes the entire region. The national government represents each state's government, which should represent the people, including the minority, in each state. Representatives decide the rules and make the laws. Education helps to provide people with liberty, life, happiness, health, and purpose. Everyone has a piece of the representation, and a right to function and to live well. The majority rules, and the minority is represented to protect the inherent rights of the people. A democracy (government is ruled "by the people"): "a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives." The government supports everyone having an informed voice, the government represents the majority of the voice to meet their needs, and voices make the laws through their votes. Everyone has inherent rights. The debate over which set of ideas, or system of government runs in my head. I feel like I can understand both sides, I can see from both perspectives, I may not understand enough to make a firm judgment, I may not know all of the details to voice a strong opinion. The United States of America is a Democratic Republic in that the Government is ruled by an elected group, hears and supports the minority's voice, and expresses the needs of the majority. The United States of America is a representational democracy. [Citing Republic vs. Democracy](https://www.thoughtco.com/republic-vs-democracy-4169936)

## The Purpose of Studying History ##
The purpose of studying history and the humanities is to learn to become a morally and spiritually engaged individual who has free agency, engages ethically with humanity, learns and discovers new things about life for a lifetime. No one needs to know everything. I believe it's life-fulling to aspire to learn at least one new thing every day. History is an expression of experiences, individual and collective. The study of history is the study of what has always and already been there, the stories unmasked. The study of history is the art of telling stories, and the art of communication. Some believe history is objective. Some believe history is subjective. There exist different viewpoints on the same thing. In the Newseum, "journalism is the first draft of history."

<br>

## Thinking Above Political Lines ##
Every individual is God's son or daughter, and his or her thought has the freedom to rest above the political lines and social statuses drawn in the country or the world through loving each individual. Leaning on the divine substance, women can express feminine and masculine qualities, men can express masculine and feminine qualities; buoyantly, women and men can fluidly work in different spheres of the economy and depend wholly on God, the *consciousness of good*, not any false beliefs about mankind.

<br>

## It All Started in Virginia ##
It all started in Virginia, the home of the virgin, native land. Some people chose liberty, traveled across the seas, and landed in Virginia. They had no idea what they would discover, but they discovered some new land for freedom's mark. Not everything was perfect when they discovered this new land. There were hypocrites, and there was violent behavior. ...But the sail they had set launched the way for some pioneering people.

<br>

## Miseducated ##
Miseducated. Lifelong learning. You are what you know. You are what you don't know. What you don't know is who you can become.

<br>

## Vocabulary Usage ##
There was once a beautiful, *roan* horse. He was not only the prettiest horse; but also the fastest horse. In the fields by the *purling* river, the horses enjoyed racing each other. The *cohesive* pack of horses continued to love to have races desptie the fact that Rapido would win everytime. In fact, the winner of the race was given *farina*. It became a routine to give this prize of farina to Rapido upon finishing the race. One day during the races, an *incoherent* group of bay hourses suddenly attacked the roan horses. The roan horses decided that they needed a reader for the battle against the bay horses. Because of Rapido's *renown* for his *inherent* speed, they *denominated* him as their leader. Upon being chosen, Rapido *hesitated*. He did not believe he would serve as a good leader and claimed that it had to be a *misnomer*. Rapido began to pray to the magical spirit, his fetish, and decided to take on the task of leading his pack of roan horses. Unlike the bay horses, Marido's horses *adhered* to each other. Their *adhesion* made them stronger. After a very close battle, the roan horses won.

## Martin Luther King, Jr. Event ##
In Washington, DC, I attended the event at the Chapel with Martin Luther King, Jr. III. He encouraged people to walk outside their bubbles and meet new people to learn from other perspectives. Since then, I met someone who encouraged me to learn about Malcolm X, the Arabs, and the Spanish ancestry. I have read two civil rights leaders and understood two different perspectives. One perspective is that "it's not the color of your skin but the content of your character" that matters. The second perspective slightly differs, and it is that "Black is powerful" and "Black is beautiful". I met some people in Norfolk, and I met some other people in Memphis, St. Louis, and Washington, DC. I have learned about their individualities, and unique perspectives and strengths. I have learned how Black leaders have inspired their thinking. I also restarted a friendship with someone from high school. In school, it can feel like people limit people from reaching out of their bubbles to meet new people, but in the real world, it's helpful that people encourage people to learn from other walks of life.

## A Young Boy's Gratitude ##
A little boy lives in the basement of a house. He has a heart filled with gratitude for all the good going on. Each night, he thinks of one more thing he's grateful for. His heart grows and grows and grows so that all the thoughts of gratitude fill the whole house. The heart of gratitude floods the staircase, spills into other places in the home, and runs into his park, school, and city. His parents and the other people around him can feel this gratitude. One heart filled with gratitude can change the life of everyone around. His parents and other people start filling their hearts with gratitude also, so that all of the hearts grow and grow and grow.

## Secret Admirer ##
He had a secret admirer but he didn't know her name. Every day, she came home and peeled off petals from flowers. "He likes me, he likes me not", she said multiple times. "He likes me, he likes me not". "He likes me, he likes me not". All the petals fell to the grass as she repeated this sentence. She smiled and said, "I hope he likes me" as she let the petals fall to the ground. She took the flower petals to school and said, "I like you a lot, and here are some flower petals for you." He responded, "I like you too" and took the petals in his hand. He made a necklace out of the petals, and he went up to her and said, "this necklace is for you, and let's be friends." She wore the necklace every day to school, and he would smile at her across the room. They held hands, and they became best friends forever. What a wonderful type of love that starts with a flower and its petals.

## A New Day ##
It's a new day for the sun to shine.
Wake up, and be free. The day is yours, and the day is mine.

It's a really great day for the sky to be blue.
Look up high! And see the birds soaring too!

On this new day the birds really sing.
It's fun to sing with the birds and hear their songs ringaling.

It's a new day for the earth to move.
It's amazing how all the people really get into a groove.

On this new day I've got two feet on the ground.
It's love that makes the world go around.

It's a really great day to go out and seize the day.
Neighbors wave, and people laugh and play.

It's a new day to run and skip outside.
It's more wonderful to do this with friends by my side.

On this new day I wear a smile on my face.
I do all that I need to do with a heart filled with grace.

## Flying Solo - Rough Draft ##
There's a bird sitting on the fence alone. <br>
She lifts her wings so gracefully. <br>
How I long to be like this lone bird, <br>
Peacefully knowing who I am. <br>

<br>

## The Lone Bird - Rough Draft ##
The lone bird flies high through the spring trees. <br>
The lone bird sits still on the ground. <br>
The lone bird sails gracefully on the yellow driving sign. <br>
The lone bird rests on a walking sign. <br>
The lone bird launches and lands onto a brown tree branch.  <br>
The lone bird flutters with the wind amongst the green leaves. <br>
The lone bird rises high in the sky. <br>
The lone bird perches on the electric wire. <br>
The lone bird mounts on the street sign. <br>
The lone bird glides with the wind. <br>
The lone bird pecks at the lead.  <br>
The lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground. <br>
The lone red bird finds her spot on a machine outside. <br>
The lone blue jay stands on a fence. <br>
The lone bird explores her freedom. <br>
The lone bird finds her support on the power line. <br>
The lone bird scurries through the grass. <br>
The lone grey bird expands her wings. <br>
The lone bird swoops down to hover the river. <br>
The lone bird feathers her wings above the water. <br>
The big lone bird stands on the grass near the farm holding her poise. <br>
The lone bird skates on the ice. <br>
The shadow of the lone bird is beautiful in the grass. <br>
The bird alone on the city map, she knows her city and she loves the water. <br>
The lone bird knows her place on the wire. <br>

## Smile Like You Mean It ##
Smile like you mean it. <br>
In the pain, and the tears, and the fight within, smile like you mean it. <br>
In the loss for words, and the heartbreak, smile that winning smile. <br>
You smile like a ray of light. <br>
Your face lights up the whole room and brightens someone's day. <br>
Your face makes someone feel at ease and cheers someone's heart. <br>
Smile like you mean it. <br>
Let the glow shine. <br>
Your smile is yours to share, and it is yours to wear. <br>

<br>

## Girl, Stop ##
Girl, stop, and take a look.
You got a smile to wear.
You got a style to share.
Please take a hard look.

You are wonderful.
You are beautiful.
So mirror, mirror,
please see a little clearer.

## It is Ok ##
It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to let the heart tear inside. <br>
It's ok to let the tears flow. <br>
It's ok to let it break inside. <br>
It's ok to let the heart ache. <br>
It's ok to feel. <br>
It's ok. Let it out. <br>
It's ok to express emotions and thoughts. <br>
Sometimes the anger and other emotions mask the need to cry and to feel. <br>
It is ok. <br>

It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to feel. <br> 
It should feel good to sing. <br>

It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to let the tears flow. <br>
It's ok to cry. <br>
It's like the water droplets after a heavy rain. <br>

<br>

## Truth ##
The truth can be ugly. <br>
The truth is hard to hide. <br>
The truth cannot be lied about. <br>
The truth can be uncovered. <br>
The truth is real. <br>
The truth is just. <br>
The truth is beautiful. <br>
The truth is within. <br>
The truth is there. <br>
The truth is free. <br>
The truth is light. <br>
The truth lifts her wings in a world full of colors. <br>
The truth lives on. <br>
The truth is at the center. <br>
The truth is within everyone's hearts. <br>
The truth raises her voice. <br>
The truth shares her wisdom. <br>
The truth can be tough to bear. <br>

## My Own Way ##
Momma’s never left Shelby County <br>
And don’t want nobody telling her what to do <br>
But I got faraway dreams, ain’t no townie <br>
This place is just for passing through <br>

<br>

## But Not Today ##
I’ve been crying, crying, crying <br>
But not today <br>
Learning to leave it in yesterday <br>

## What is the best thing you have ever been given? ##
While roaming the streets of Washington, DC, I met three people from the Muslim faith. The best thing I've been given is the gift of Muslim prayers, knowledge of the Moors, and an understanding of Cairo, Egypt and Spain. The best thing I was given was the chance to help a man in DC and meet new friends, Bilal and Kareem.
