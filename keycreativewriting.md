## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
With a heart yearning to express itself.

In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
With ivory yearning to be tickled.

'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
With stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
and in return she receives a great gift.

Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
Her eyes no longer shed tears.
Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
Her heart has found freedom.
And her mind has found relief.

She is now content
With the company of a friend.

## Children's Play ##
Playing on the keys without words,
She discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.
