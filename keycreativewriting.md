## An English teacher who taught creative writing to students in high school inspired students to write down observations creatively. Another English teacher in high school who taught the American Credo Project empowered students to discover a passion for literature and music. I love creative writing supports expressing feelings and thoughts. The author Rachel Held Evans shares the fact that some people have discovered that The Psalmist serves as a great psychologist in her book entitled *Inspired: Slaying Giants, Walking on Water, and Loving the Bible Again* (p. 109). I agree with this discovery, and I am experimenting with writing poetry. I write a little bit each day and edit a little bit each day. It would be fun to teach youth in my life and help them learn to use their voice. ##

## Creative writing starts with observation and articulation. Creative writing comes from verbalizing visual and auditory observations and articulating feelings and experiences. Creative writing stems from asking interesting questions and imagining. ##

## In the American Credo project, I remember composing a song on the piano, and taking photos of music and water. This journey of writing music and setting poetry to music continues. ##

## In the Creative Writing class, I remember writing down goals to explore how children's books and the media help to teach children concepts. I compared Disney to PBS Kids, and I wrote down goals of writing children's books. An exploration of best practices of writing books for children continues. ##

## People encourage engineers to write poetry as well. In engineering, people write snippets of code, structure code logically and creatively, and think in and about systems. In poetry, people write snippets of words, and learn to structure words and code creatively and logically. ##

## Through a career, I hope to work as a liberal engineer, bringing together culture, social sciences, history, literature, and engineering. I also hope to explore teaching students at the elementary, high school, or college levels. ##

## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
With a heart yearning to express itself.

In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
With ivory yearning to be tickled.

'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
With stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
and in return she receives a great gift.

Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
Her eyes no longer shed tears.
Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
Her heart has found freedom.
And her mind has found relief.

She is now content
With the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing on the keys without words,
She discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

<br>

## E Pluribus Unum ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to say the right thing.

I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.

I am a body in a sea of bodies learning to be free.

I am a heart in a sea of hearts crying out to love more.

I am a set of eyes in a set of eyes looking to see the good going on.

I am one of a kind in the sea of humanity.

Like a drop of water ripples outwardly, I am one of many leading to ripples outwardly in a sea of ripples.

I am one in a million. There are a million ways to say and do the same thing.

<br>

## In My Own Words ##
I am Margaret Furr, it rhymes with concur.
I am a writer, and I aspire to write a book over a lifetime.
I am musical, and I love looking at different angles to articulate a balance between the feminine and masculine perspectives in songs.
I am an engineer, who loves methods to the madness.
I am a dancer, like my grandmother, who smiled, glistened, and glow.
I am an educator, who loves STEAM.
I dare to believe again, dream again, and smile that winning smile after the storm.

<br>

## Flowers Blossomed on the Earth ##
Flowers blossomed on the earth.

Three people took photos of it.

One person sketched it.

Another took a video of it.

Two people painted it, and another saw the harmony of looking at all seven, saying **wow, collectively this is God's handiwork art!**"

A painting of everyone looking to the same flower with different tools and eyes - I've seen these types of flowers in 2-3 places, and other people see them too.

Someone else is looking to this same flower.

3-7 people appreciating it in different ways.

<br>

## America Reborn ##
I once had a vision, or a dream of American reborn.
I love that women are behind the rebirth of the American dream and that black men can lead the country well.
Women are behind the rebirth of the American dream through the work in the postal office and the elections.
A sense of America reborn actually came a live in 2021, but this great American dream was alive all the time with all the people that have gone before expressing freedom, marching towards the light, overcoming, and freeing other people from bondage.

<br>

## Flickering Lights ##
The flickering lights shine brightly in the hearts of all the people like golden balls throughout the nation and the earth.
The flickering lights glow in the homes and office buildings united that windows provide and entrance to.
The flickering lights twinkle in the night sky that reach other galaxies.
The flickering lights mark the course in the middle of sea.
The flickering lights reflect through the water.

<br>

## City Lights ##
City lights.

The lights at night are on.
A hard day at work is done.

The day is done.
The night is on.

The people have left work.
The light supports their action.

It's loud and silent at the same time.

All the rooms twinkle like the stars in the night sky.

<br>

## Secret Admirer ##
He had a secret admirer but he didn't know her name.

Every day, she came home and peeled off petals from flowers.

'He likes me, he likes me not'
'He likes me, he likes me not'
'He likes me, he likes me not'

All the petals fell to the grass as she repeated this sentence.

She smiled and said, 'I hope he likes me' as she let the petals fall to the ground.

She took the flower petals to school and said, 'I like you a lot, and here are some flower petals for you.'

He responded, 'I like you too' and took the petals in his hand.

He made a necklace out of the petals, and he went up to her and said, 'this necklace is for you, and let's be friends.'

She wore the necklace every day to school, and he would smile at her across the room.

They held hands, and they became best friends forever.

What a wonderful type of love that starts with a flower and its petals.

## It's A New Day #
It's a new day for the sun to shine
for the birds to chirp
for me to meet a new friend.

I love to sing out loud
and let go all of the doubt
and feel love in my heart
for everyone.

It's a new day for the flowers to bloom
for the rain to fall
for the neighbors to wave.

I love to skip out side
and run to the park
and feel joy in my heart
with everyone.

## The Democratic Republic and the Debate Inside My Head ##
Two parties of people govern the nation. Each party represents a set of ideas for how to represent the people, a set of philosophies for how to govern people with
order, and a set of ways to handle collective challenges. No party has absolute control. The party in control has representative power over a set of people and
over the collective whole. The party not in control also represents another set of people. The governmental structure builds in a space for dialogue, or a debate
that gives room for disagreement that can yield to agreement. Not everyone has to agree, but everyone should point their thought to the greater good that supports
the life, love, and soul that exists within people's hearts and minds. New ideas can evolve out of conflict and disagreement, leading to something better than
before. A new nation is built everytime conflict erupts so destructively. A republic (government is a **public matter**): **a state in which supreme power is held
by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch**. The republic constitutes the entire
region. The national government represents each state's government, which should represent the people, including the minority, in each state. Representatives
decide the rules and make the laws. Education helps to provide people with liberty, life, happiness, health, and purpose. Everyone has a piece of the
representation, and a right to function and to live well. The majority rules, and the minority is represented to protect the "inalieanble rights" of the people. A
democracy (government is ruled **by the people**): **a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through
elected representatives**. The government supports everyone having an informed voice, the government represents the majority of the voice to meet their needs, and
voices make the laws through their votes. Everyone has 'inalieanable rights'. The debate over which set of ideas, or system of government runs in my head. I feel
like I can understand both sides, I can see from both perspectives, I may not understand enough to make a firm judgment, I may not know all of the details to voice
a strong opinion. The United States of America is a Democratic Republic in that the Government is ruled by an elected group, hears and supports the minority's
voice, and expresses the needs of the majority. The United States of America is a representational democracy. [Citing Republic vs. Democracy

Smile like you mean it.
In the pain, and the tears, and the fight within, smile like you mean it.
In the loss for words, and the heartbreak, smile that winning smile.
You smile like a ray of light.
It lights up the whole room.
It brightens up someone's day.
It makes someone feel at ease.
It cheers someone's heart.
So, smile like you mean it.
Let the glow shine.
It is yours to share.
It is yours to wear.

## The Purpose of Studying History ##
The purpose of studying history and the humanities is to learn to become a morally and spiritually engaged individual who has free agency, engages ethically with humanity, learns and discovers new things about life for a lifetime.

No one needs to know everything. I believe it's life-fulling to aspire to learn at least one new thing every day.

History is an expression of experiences, individual and collective.

The study of history is the study of what has always and already been there, the stories unmasked.

The study of history is the art of telling stories, and the art of communication.

Some believe history is objective. Some believe history is subjective. There exist different viewpoints on the same thing.

In the Newseum, "journalism is the first draft of history".
