## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
<br> with a heart yearning to express itself.
<br>
<br> In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
<br> with ivory yearning to be tickled.
<br>
<br>'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
<br> with stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
<br> and in return she receives a great gift.
<br>
<br>Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
<br> Her eyes no longer shed tears.
<br> Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
<br> Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
<br> Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
<br> Her heart has found freedom.
<br> And her mind has found relief.
<br>
<br> She is now content
<br> with the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing music on the keys,
she discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

<br>

## What Can America Achieve? ##
Despair, 
<br> enormous, steep,
<br> scorching, perishing, callousing,
<br> The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
<br> overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
<br> bright, energetic,
<br> Hope.

<br>

## A New Day ##
It's a new day for the sun to shine.
Wake up, and be free. The day is yours, and the day is mine.

It's a really great day for the sky to be blue.
Look up high! And see the birds soaring too!

On this new day the birds really sing.
It's fun to sing with the birds and hear their songs ringaling.

It's a new day for the earth to move.
It's amazing how all the people really get into a groove.

On this new day I've got two feet on the ground.
It's love that makes the world go around.

It's a really great day to go out and seize the day.
Neighbors wave, and people laugh and play.

It's a new day to run and skip outside.
It's more wonderful to do this with friends by my side.

On this new day I wear a smile on my face.
I do all that I need to do with a heart filled with grace.

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 1 ##
One night, Gabby complained to mama, "I had a terrible day today".
Gabby then said, "nothing at all went my way!"

Mama responded, "that's ok" but encouraged Gabby to have an attitude of gratitude.
"But be thankful", she told Gabby, "because that will help you have a joyful mood!"

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings.
And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright.
And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

"There's so much", Gabby said, "to be grateful for!"
"I am going to think of more and more and more!"

"I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend.
The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

I am grateful for my teacher who teaches us how to read.
Today we read a book by Jory John, which is called 'The Bad Seed'.

I am grateful for the lunch server who always smiles at my classmates and me.
She's always wearing a pretty bracelet that says 'Be Free'.

I am grateful for recess when we went to the playground.
Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school.
Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for the spaghetti my brother and I ate for dinner.
The pasta was so good because it was thinner."

Then Gabby said, "Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer.
Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is indeed the answer!"

"Good job on being grateful", said mama. "This list is yours to keep.
And now that you've developed this list, you can sweetly sleep".

"Good night", said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss.
"Tomorrow night I will share another list."

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 2 ##
Every night Gabby snuggled in bed with mama. 
And every night Gabby and mama talked about how the day went in their pajamas. 

One night, before bed, Gabby complained to mama, “I had a terrible day today”. 
Gabby then said, “nothing at all went my way!”

“I’m so sorry,” said mama, “what happened?”
“What has made you feel so saddened and maddened?”

“I forgot to set my alarm clock last night,” said Gabby, “and that led me to miss the bus.
Then, when I got to school late, my teacher made a big fuss. 

When we had coloring time I did not get to use my favorite crayon. 
When I looked in the box for my favorite purple one it was gone. 

Someone in my class spilled juice on me, and it got on my shirt. 
Unfortunately it also stained my new skirt!

There was a leak in the roof, and I got wet.
Getting wet made me feel so upset. 

At recess, while running and playing tag, I slipped. 
Because I fell on the ground, my tshirt ripped.

And tonight for dinner we ate a disgusting meal. 
It was a grownup dish that had in it salmon and eel.” 

Mama responded, “I understand. That all sounds terrible.” 
“I’m sure right now life feels really unbearable.”

“But,” mama said “I encourage you to keep an attitude of gratitude.
Being thankful will help you stay in a joyful mood!

You can pay attention to all the good things that happen too. 
And when you think of these things, you won’t feel as blue.”

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings. 
And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright. 
And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

“There’s so much”, Gabby said, “to be grateful for!” 
“I am going to think of more and more and more!”

“I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school.

(I am grateful for my brother’s and my dinner: Mac and cheese. 
I also tried the vegetables and liked the peas.”

OR 

I am grateful for the spaghetti my brother and I ate for dinner. 
I liked the noodles because they were thinner.”)

Then Gabby said, “Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer. 
Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is the answer!”

“Sometimes life does not always go my way.”
“But if I remember the good things that happen, it brightens the day.”

“Good job on being grateful”, said mama. “This list is yours to keep. 
And now that you’ve developed this list, you can sweetly sleep”.

“Good night”, said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss. 
“Tomorrow night I will share another list.”

## Boots ##
These boots of mine that I love. They've really been everywhere. <br>
They've walked down many roads. <br>
They've dug their heels into the dirt. <br>
Can't you see? They've really been worn. <br>

These worn-down boots that I love. They've traveled the world. <br>
They've stepped on rocks. <br>
They've run through grass. <br>
Can't you see? They have some holes in the soles. <br>

These beloved boots are mine. They've been my best friend. <br>
They've gone down lonely pathways. <br>
They've skipped across sidewalks. <br>
Can't you see? They've become sturdy and strong. <br>

These wonderful boots that I love. I keep them tied real tight. <br>
They've kept me feeling snug. <br>
They're as comfortable as can be. <br>
Can't you see? They're my favorite. <br>

These boots of mine that I love. They've really gone the extra mile. <br>
They've done more than I could've asked for. <br>
They've survived the hard work. <br>
Can't you see? There's some pep in every step with them. <br>

<br>

## Just Live ##
Just live. <br>
It's all you have got to do. <br>
Truly live. <br>
Take it all in. <br>
Do something new. <br>
Have a good laugh. <br>
Dance on the street. <br>
Play some great music. <br>
Live. <br>
Really live. <br>

<br>

## I Am One in A Sea ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to say something kind.

I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.

I am a body in a sea of bodies learning to be free.

I am a heart in a sea of hearts seeking to love more.

I am a set of eyes in a sea of eyes looking to see the good.

## Flying Solo - Rough Draft ##
There's a bird sitting on the fence alone. <br>
She lifts her wings so gracefully. <br>
How I long to be like this lone bird, peacefully knowing who I am. <br>

<br>

## The Lone Bird ##
The lone bird flies high through the spring trees. <br>
The lone bird sits still on the ground. <br>
The lone bird sails gracefully on the yellow driving sign. <br>
The lone bird rests on a walking sign. <br>
The lone bird launches and lands onto a brown tree branch.  <br>
The lone bird flutters with the wind amongst the green leaves. <br>
The lone bird rises high in the sky. <br>
The lone bird perches on the electric wire. <br>
The lone bird glides with the wind. <br>
The lone bird pecks at the lead.  <br>
The lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground. <br>
The lone bird stands on a fence. <br>
The lone bird finds her support on the power line. <br>
The lone bird scurries through the grass. <br>
The lone bird expands her wings. <br>
The lone bird swoops down to hover over the river. <br>
The lone bird feathers her wings above the water. <br>
The lone bird stands on the grass. <br>
The lone bird skates on the ice. <br>

<br>

## Smile Like You Mean It ##
Smile like you mean it. <br>
In the pain, and the tears, and the fight within, smile like you mean it. <br>
In the loss for words, and the heartbreak, smile that winning smile. <br>
You smile like a ray of light. <br>
Your face lights up the whole room and brightens someone's day. <br>
Your face makes someone feel at ease and cheers someone's heart. <br>
Smile like you mean it. <br>
Let the glow shine. <br>
Your smile is yours to share, and it is yours to wear. <br>

<br>

## Girl, Stop ##
Girl, stop, and take a look.
You got a smile to wear.
You got a style to share.
Please take a hard look.

You are wonderful.
You are beautiful.
So mirror, mirror,
please see a little clearer.

<br>

## My Own Way ##
Momma’s never left Shelby County <br>
And don’t want nobody telling her what to do <br>
But I got faraway dreams, ain’t no townie <br>
This place is just for passing through <br>

<br>

## But Not Today ##
I’ve been crying, crying, crying <br>
But not today <br>
Learning to leave it in yesterday <br>

<br>
