## Through creative writing, I practice observation and use words thoughtfully. I am particularly experimenting with writing country music song lyrics, children's books, and spiritual or Christian poetry. Check out my creative writing below. ##

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## the traffic guard (a poem I wrote as a senior in high school) ##
she stands there every day
<br> in the distress of crying clouds,
<br> in the frigid darkness of naked trees,
<br> and in the stifling heat which signals
<br> the last day on the calendar drawing near.

but every day
<br> she stands as if the sun is singing.
<br> she raises her hand and brushes it through the air
<br> sharing an infinity of smiles.

<br> some mornings, i feel upbeat.
<br> and i return the smile.
<br> other days, i feel gloomy, stressed
<br> so i quickly avert my eyes
<br> as i slip into a lonely, black rectangle
<br> between two silver SUVs.

<br>

## the friend (a poem I wrote in high school) ##
sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
<br> with a heart yearning to express itself.
<br>
<br> in another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
<br> with ivory yearning to be tickled.
<br>
<br>'why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
<br> with stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
<br> and in return she receives a great gift.
<br>
<br> her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
<br> her eyes no longer shed tears.
<br> her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
<br> her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
<br> her soul spreads its wings and flies.
<br> her heart has found freedom.
<br> and her mind has found relief.
<br>
<br> she is now content
<br> with the company of a friend.

<br>

## children's play ##
playing music on the keys,
she discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

the sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

<br>

## What Can America Achieve? ##
Despair, 
<br> enormous, steep,
<br> scorching, perishing, callousing,
<br> The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
<br> overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
<br> bright, energetic,
<br> Hope.

<br>

## From the Past to the Future ##
Past,
<br> fond, sentimental,
<br> remembering, romanticizing, reminiscing,
<br> Letting go of the old to reign in the new - 
<br> hoping, expecting, anticipating,
<br> promising, optimistic,
<br> Future.

<br> 

## the american flag ##
standing high, it represents the home of the brave.
<br> and with each blow of the wind, you'll see it flap and wave.
<br> not only does it stand high; it stands big and tall.
<br> not just one person it stands for; it stands for all.
<br> it's a flag for everyone from sea to shining sea.
<br> it's a flag for freedom, unity, and democracy.
<br> you can find it all over the place across the country.
<br> you'll find it near truck stops, or even in a tree.
<br> it has 13 stripes that are bright red and white.
<br> and it has 50 stars like the ones you see at night.

<br>

## working in the truckstop diner ##
i'm reminiscing about the good old days
<br> when this work didn't feel so lonely.
<br> i am grateful for the strangers who come,
<br> but not as many come these days.

i'm cleaning up some greasy food.
<br> i'm throwing away uneaten pie.
<br> i was happier back then,
<br> but I've got to be grateful for the good.

at least one couple sat in this booth,
<br> leaving a napkin on the checkered floors.
<br> the restaurant hasn't totally been forgotten;
<br> it's just not as good as when it was in its youth.

<br>

## everything's better with a little bit of butter ## 
sudaes are better with the cherry on top
<br> and gingerbread houses, with some gum drops
<br> cookies are better with chocolate chips baked in
<br> and cake's better with thick icing, not thin

hot cocoa is better with a little whipped cream
<br> and sodas are better with a scoop of ice cream
<br> tea is better with some milk and honey
<br> peanut butter is better when it's nutty

marshmallows are better with chocolate and grahams
<br> toast is better with some cream cheese and jams
<br> popcorn is better with a handful of m&ms
<br> and pudding's better with assorted fruit gems 

peppermint sticks are better with lemons
<br> custard's better with fresh watermelons
<br> sweet potatoes are better with brown sugar
<br> and everything's better with a little bit of butter

<br>

## a new day ##
it's a new day for the sun to shine.
<br> wake up, and be free. the day is yours, and the day is mine.

it's a really great day for the sky to be blue.
<br> look up high! and see the birds soaring too!

on this new day the birds really sing.
<br> it's fun to sing with the birds and hear their songs ringaling.

it's a new day for the earth to move.
<br> it's amazing how all the people really get into a groove.

on this new day i've got two feet on the ground.
<br> it's love that makes the world go around.

it's a really great day to go out and seize the day.
<br> neighbors wave, and people laugh and play.

it's a new day to run and skip outside.
<br> it's more wonderful to do this with friends by my side.

on this new day i wear a smile on my face.
<br> i do all that i need to do with a heart filled with grace.

<br>

## in love's absence ##
in love's absence,
<br> there's hatred;
<br> and hatred is like darkness:
<br> the absence of the light.
<br> both are like death, and evil,
<br> the absence of life, and goodness.

all are a negation
<br> of what is really real;
<br> and all are a contradiction
<br> of the true ideal.
<br> this is why,
<br> when light shines thorugh the darkness,
<br> the light casts out the dark.
<br> so,
<br> likewise,
<br> when love expresses itself,
<br> through the hateful heart,
<br> love penetrates the hate,
<br> causing it to transform
<br> into compassion, and then love.

the word absence connotes not
<br> that something else exists;
<br> and rather it connotes
<br> that something is failing to exist.
<br> the something is the only substance
<br> that can displace the absence
<br> of what is failing to exist.

<br>
## it's a beautiful thing ##
it’s a beautiful thing to share a smile with someone on the street and see and feel the light in a stranger that you greet.

it’s a beautiful thing to hold the door open for someone and lighten their load as they are carrying a ton. 

it’s a beautiful thing to buy flowers for a friend and have them delivered at the day’s end. 

it’s a beautiful thing to write a handwritten note and share some kind words and an inspiring quote. 

it’s a beautiful thing to let someone go in front of you and help them not wait so long in the queue. 

it’s a beautiful thing to buy a gift for your family member and show that you care and that them you remember. 

<br>

## God stays relentless ##
God is a God,
<br> who in the pursuit of you,
<br> stays relentless.
<br> the effort, with which
<br> God loves you
<br> is endless;
<br> God stays relentless.
<br> God never quits,
<br> and to the force of the enemy,
<br> God never submits.
<br> God rather commits.
<br> God commits to you,
<br> and stays relentless.

<br> 

## how will i best use the moment? ##
how will I best use the moment?
<br> will I pray?….or will I vent?

will I think about all that’s going on?
<br> or will I think about all that’s going wrong?

i must say that life is more joyous when I pray.
<br> and living in gratitude for God is the way.

so i will make the most of each minute, each day.
<br> i will remember to love and thank God always.

and i will find a way to help someone somewhere.
<br> i will turn to God to help me show some care.

<br> 

## God's grand story ##
for your life, eternally to God be the glory;
<br> so let Him conceive of and write your whole story.

your story He’s been writing since the beginning of time.
<br> he’s been thinking you up as someone loved and divine.

this story never ends; it’s always unfolding.
<br> in His eyes you’re amazing; your character he’s molding.

there’s never been a minute when you’ve been separated from Him.
<br> God has not created you without thought on a whim.

yes, sometimes mortal lies sure do like to creep in.
<br> like “i’m lacking, i can't succeed, or i’m full of sin!”.

but God can reveal a world full of His plans.
<br> for in reality everything is ordered in His hands.

so choose to see you in the way God sees you.
<br> be part of what He’s crafting with the grand view.

<br> 

## no need to compare ##
sometimes i struggle with the tendency to compare, 
<br> and i struggle with the suggestion that life is unfair. 

but I stop to see this as the tempter’s great snare, 
<br> for God provides for me and all everywhere. 

so if you’re struggling as well, be true to you, 
<br> and don’t let the illusion skew your view. 

there’s no need to compare; you’ve got all you need. 
<br> God gives to you when you follow His lead. 

do I master this goal every day that i’m alive? 
<br> well surely it’s an endeavor for which i strive. 

and writing this poem helped me express my voice. 
<br> in these ideas that God gave me I do rejoice.

<br>

## glorious mornings in my own company ##
at 5am, before the rest of the world has awakened,
<br> i sometimes arise to tap into a faith unshaken.
<br> while reading a bit and drinking milk with honey,
<br> there's nothing more glorious than my own company.
<br> it's quiet - there are no loud cars i can hear.
<br> it's a time for me to be peaceful with God, whose dear.
<br> i can hear no other voices but my still, inner voice.
<br> a new day has begun, and in this i do rejoice.
<br> at this time of day, there's nothing competing for attention.
<br> it's just me and God, enjoying a higher dimension.
<br> this time alone is the fuel for the day ahead,
<br> as i sit alone in gratitude for my daily bread.

<br>

## to reveal all, i - ##
to reveal all, i -
<br> love the night sky.
<br> the stars shining, and twinkling
<br> give me a hopeful inkling
<br> of a God so large
<br> that only he's in charge.

<br>

## the night sky knows my secrets ##
when i look up to the night sky, i deeply commune with it;
<br> i wish upon the stars, telling the sky every secret.
<br> as i share my desires with the universe each night,
<br> i know the stars hold my hopes, and dreams in their light.
<br> trusting the stars with things i tell no one but them,
<br> i know they'll find a way to emit back what i've dreamt.
<br> many people have said that the stars hold our fate;
<br> so why not tell the sky what i wish the universe would create?
<br> i trust that the sky cares about my life's design;
<br> so this is why i tell it secrets and let the stars align.

<br>

## a poem including the words "asterisk", "burnt", and "devotion" ##
each night, i look up
<br> to the burnt yellow stars
<br> that look like asterisks in the sky,
<br> which God has written with Her handwriting,
<br> and then i say,
<br> "good night moon",
<br> thinking of just how much
<br> the Divine Author of the universe
<br> loves humanity, to it and back to earth,
<br> as
<br> my devotion.

<br>

## still a happy ending ##
it was no fairytale ending:
<br> it was one, rather, of heart mending and soul tending.
<br> she did not marry her prince with a happily ever after;
<br> instead she blossomed and began a new chapter.
<br> in the sky, she still saw her rainbow smiling.
<br> but it was the divine with which she was reconciling.
<br> she still found happiness; but she found it in herself.
<br> she realized she could not find it in anyone else.
<br> she still found true love; a love that grew and grew.
<br> but it was a love deep from God that she wedded to.
<br> so as I said before, it was no fairytale ending;
<br> but nevertheless, it was still a happy ending.

<br>

## if you can imagine it, imagine it ##
if you can imagine it, imagine it, and maybe you will achieve it, because you never know if your dreams will become reality, until you keep taking steps to achieve what you imagine in its totaly, and then, as what you wished for is happening, you'll realize the audacity of your imagining 

<br>

## so i wrote a novel ##
you told me i could not write well,
<br> so i turned around,
<br> and i wrote a novel.
<br> and to be quite honest,
<br> i'm so glad that i did
<br> because in this disbelief,
<br> i did not wallow.
<br> in my humble opinion,
<br> i don't think that
<br> it was thaaat bad of writing.
<br> i think it was actually pretty good,
<br> with some parts that were even exciting,
<br> like when Johnny met a new friend on Mars
<br> or when the two traveled the universe in spacecars.
<br> so through this experience,
<br> I've learned a lesson,
<br> which is
<br> not to let others stifle my expression.

<br>

## stay relentless ##
go after your goals,
<br> and in the pursuit of them,
<br> stay relentless.
<br> the efforts, which
<br> you put in
<br> may be endless,
<br> but stay relentless.
<br> don't ever quit,
<br> and to the force of the enemy,
<br> don't ever submit.
<br> rather commit.
<br> commit to your goals,
<br> and stay relentless.

<br>

## let us claim how right we each are ##
how about we, women, especially, dare to rebuff...
<br> the awful notion that we're either too much or not enough?
<br> instead let us claim how just right we each are,
<br> recognizing within each one of us the gold, inner star.
<br> by claiming this for ourselves, we will yield so much power.
<br> and an inner strength for us all that no one can devour.
<br> we can encourage each other to be who we're born to be.
<br> and celebrate in eahc other what makes each of us more free.

<br>

# i am a ____ before i am ____ ##
i am a human before i am a woman, and all of mankind shares being human with me in common.
<br> like all mankind, both men and women, i can think with my head...and in the morning, rise, with joy, out of bed.
<br> like both men and women, i am here on earth to learn. and as i apply what i learn, hopefully a full life i earn.
<br> like all mankind, both men and women, i can feel with my heart, filling it up with love at each day's start.
<br> and finally, like all men and women, i am never alone on the earth, and i can see others' worth while they can see my worth.

<br>

## i'm afraid the masquerade is over ##
i’m afraid the masquerade is over. 
<br> the enemies have had an exposure.
<br> i see behind the mask of lies,
<br> despite how sneaky is the guise. 
<br> covering up the legit self with error,
<br> the mask mocks the true light bearer.  
as the mask falls off, the foes flee, 
<br> leaving the real face for all to see. 

<br>

## tuning into myself ##
this month I'm tuning into myself.
<br> i'm tapping into what brings me health.
<br> i'm doing what makes me come alive.
<br> i'm focusing on areas where I thrive.
<br> i'm no longer saying yes to people blindly.
<br> i'm instead choosing things designedly.
<br> i'm no longer suppressing the negative feelings.
<br> i'm being aware of them to experience healings.

<br>

## to all of me, who i was before ##
to all of me, 
<br> who i was before, 
<br> i say thank you. 
<br> thank you so much 
<br> for getting me 
<br> to where i’m now. 

at that time then, 
<br> you didn’t know, 
<br> just where you’d be 
<br> in future years; 
<br> but thanks because 
<br> you truly have 
<br> led me so far.

thank you so much 
<br> for all the times 
<br> that you pushed through 
<br> for me, even 
<br> when i felt that
<br> i must give up. 
<br> by pressing onward, 
<br> you have shown me 
<br> how much better 
<br> life can become.

without you, i 
<br> would not be here, 
<br> so i’m grateful 
<br> for all you were. 
<br> you did not know 
<br> at that time then 
<br> who you were or
<br> would grow into. 
<br> you’d be surprised 
<br> how great you were 
<br> and who i’m, now. 

<br> 

## Weaving Webs with ‘What If?’ ##
What if for good God is working all things out?
<br> What if I have nothing really to worry about?
<br> What if I stop worrying about all of the mishaps?
<br> And what if God weaves his web for good, perhaps?
<br> …like what if I find a dollar in my washed jeans today?
<br> And what if this helps me pay for a latte at the cafe? 
<br> What if I have a good convo with the barista?
<br> And what if we talk about being an artiste?
<br> What if she then invites me to see a dance show?
<br> What if the show is about the work of Van Gogh?
<br> And then what if I begin learning to paint?
<br> What if I paint a brown cottage that’s quaint?
<br> What if I go visit a real one in the country?
<br> What if its owner invites me in for tea?
<br> What if we talk about spirituality and fine art? 
<br> What if she shares a book about the heart?
<br> What if I buy the book to read to myself?…
<br> and then donate the book to the community bookshelf? 
<br> What if someone else finds this book to read too?
<br> And what if he shares online a five star review?
<br> And what if the what ifs go on infinitely?
<br> As God weaves his web for good intricately? 

<br> 

## blossoming is my blueprint ##
i think i belong to a God who said that "blossoming is my blueprint"...
<br> because every one of life's elements is designed to support the earth's development.
<br> from the flowers growing in nature's ecosystem...
<br> to the creatures evolving in the animal kingdom,
<br> everything is outlined to support one another,
<br> and aid in recovery when forces try to smother.
<br> i think i belong to a God who said that "the world's growth is my plan"...
<br> just look at mankind's unfoldment and ever-increasing lifespan.
<br> from the unvierse of sky and stars forver expanding outwardly
<br> to the constant deepening of people's minds inwardly,
<br> everything is modeled to go on and on and on 
<br> as there is never a place on earth without a new dawn.

<br>

## A Self-Love Potion Recipe ##
I have a new self-love potion recipe.
<br> It’s better than any other prescribed remedy.
<br> It consists of some ways to seek love within;
<br> so mix them together, and pour them in. 

Ingredients:
<br> A handful of mindful moments
<br> A cup of the love deep within
<br> 10 sprinkles of affirmations
<br> A gift to yourself
<br> A spoonful of self-worthiness
<br> 30 minutes to make and drink this potion each week

Step 1:
<br> Take the time to enjoy some mindful moments,
<br> and mix them in; they are a core component.
<br> Step 2:
<br> Pour in a cup of the love within you’re soul; 
<br> this love in the drink will make you feel whole.
<br> Step 3:
<br> Sprinkle in affirmations about you that are good,
<br> including aspects of yourself that go misunderstood.
<br> Step 4:
<br> Add in what makes you happy, and give yourself a gift.
<br> Amidst fulfilling all your duties, give yourself a lift.
<br> Step 5:
<br> Gush in a spoonful of remembrance, of how you’re worthy of love. 
<br> for it is love that this potion is born of.
<br> Step 6:
<br> Set aside a time to follow these steps each week.
<br> And enjoy the potion, letting it make you feel unique. 

<br>

## I Love Me, I Love Me Not ##
I love me, I love me not…
<br> this is the push and pull that leaves me distraught…
<br> like I’ll have one loving thought…
<br> and then comes hate’s onslaught…
<br> trying to compete, playing on repeat, and working to defeat…
<br> all the thoughts towards myself of love that I’ve had
<br> to make me again feel bad…and sad… rather than glad. 
<br> Do I listen to the hate? Do I take the bait?
<br> If I’m wise, with love, I can argue back,
<br> and overcome, with love, the hateful attack. 
<br> I love me, I love me not…
<br> it’s like a childhood game…
<br> of picking flower petals in love’s name…
<br> but this time, it’s not over a boy…
<br> it’s over self-hatred’s ploy:
<br> the ploy to steal my joy.  
I love me, I love me not…
<br> Which one do I choose?
<br> Do I withstand the hateful abuse? 
<br> Or towards myself do I seek clearer views?
<br> I love me, I love me not…
<br> At last, I choose I love me…
<br> because it’s love that sets me free. 

<br>

## does my mind repeat itself? ##
does my mind repeat itself? and do i seriously need help?
<br> because i can't, for the life of me, put the recurring thoughts on the shelf.

i seem to entertain some thoughts obsessively.
<br> the thoughts occur to me pretty aggresively.
<br> they even echo when i look at them objectively.

my thoughts reiterate like a broken record.
<br> the same thoughts play in a way that's absurd.
<br> but i know my thought patterns can be conquered.

<br>

## framing this moment ##
i'm framing this moment…
because it was a moment well-spent,
as I felt contentment…
and a higher sense of fulfillment.
i'll hang the frame on the wall…
so that I'll be able to recall,
and see a remnant…
of this glorious moment.

<br>

## love's ripples ##
humans' love for each other expands like ripples on the water's surface.
<br> one person smiles, or wave stheir hand, or helps another through an active of service;
<br> and the one impacted by the act of service passes it forward, leading the next affected to pass it also forward...
<br> ...until all of humanity joins together in creating a more beautiful world,
<br> consisting of concentric cirlces of love forever dilating....
<br> all because of kindness begetting kindness in a way that's radiating and regenerating.

<br>

## Most People are Kind ##
When I open my eyes there’ a truth that I find.
<br> The fact that I find is that most people are kind.

Like strangers smile kindly at me in public spaces.
<br> It’s so uplifting to connect with such welcoming faces.

And strangers make room for me when I’m driving in traffic.
<br> They help me switch lanes in ways that are empathic.

And people I know make space to listen to me.
<br> I can tell what they want for me is for me to feel free.

These are just a few ways that people have been kind.
<br> They give me hope in the goodness of mankind.

So if you’re having a rough time in life, it’s ok.
<br> But know there are many making this be a better day.

<br>

## Emotions ##
I feel a little exhausted emotionally, honestly
<br> I’ve been through all the highs and lows
<br> One big feeling after the next 
<br> I just can’t get a break from the throes

These feelings feel like a hurricane 
<br> I just don’t know what to do with them
<br> These feelings feel like a whirlwind too
<br> They sure do cause me a lot of mayhem 

But sometimes I find a glimpse of peace 
<br> As I hear God’s voice when I pray 
<br> Sometimes I find a glimpse of goodness 
<br> As a glimmer hope shines through my day

The peace within shows me what’s real
<br> And the glimpse of goodness stills my heart 
<br> The glimmer of hope eases my pain 
<br> And shows me that from love I can never part  

These stormy feelings are not really mine 
<br> They’re just trying to stop me from being me  
<br> These feelings are just destructive feelings  
<br> that pull me away from what makes me feel free 

<br>

## don't forget to look up ##
don’t forget to look up at the sky.
<br> and when you do, look up high,
<br> pay attention to the birds soaring by,
<br> and see how in a flock they orderly fly.

<br>

## don't forget to open your eyes ## 
don’t forget to open your eyes, 
<br> see the new day dawning in the sunrise,
<br> and how all of nature is harmonized. 
<br> There’s beauty all around that you may realize. 

<br>

## don't forget to open your heart ##
don’t forget to open your heart
<br> with a fresh attitude at each day’s start. 
<br> be willing to give freely and do your part,
<br> and live your life like it’s a work of art

<br>

## the smell of cinnamon ##
there's something about the smell of cinnamon...
<br> on Sunday mornings, on freshly baked buns...
<br> it's such a joy to smell it when opening the oven...
<br> with the scent making it hard not to eat more than one.
<br> as i soak the bun in my joe so that it's nice and soft,
<br> and bring it up to my mouth, i love the spice's waft.
<br> i switch from picking up the bun and "The Age",
<br> leaving a trail of the smell on every newspaper page.
<br> and then for hours after breakfast is finished,
<br> the scent's still on my hands; it has't diminished. 

<br>

## Careers Introduction ##
Every day on the earth people everywhere work,
<br> with some making art; and some working as a clerk. 

In the world there are over 12,000 types of jobs. 
<br> People everywhere work because they don’t want to be slobs. 

So let’s go on an adventure and learn about careers,
<br> to help you decide what you can do in future years. 

From a truck driver to a teacher there’s many things you can be. 
<br> I hope you can find the work that lets you feel free.

I’m going to introduce you to six different workers. 
<br> They work hard every day; they surely aren’t shirkers!

<br>

## The Architect ##
He starts work every morning by eight-thirty 
<br> with some tea to drink before getting his hands dirty. 

His job requires him to be analytical and creative. 
<br> He also gets to be original and innovative. 

He shares these traits by producing plans for structures. 
<br> He’s the one who designs the building for constructors.

Every type of building from a home to a skyscraper 
<br> is what he sketches and draws on draft paper. 

Intricate details for a foundation he lays,
<br> of spaces in which people can spend their days.

And something else he does is make sure designs follow laws.
<br> He must ensure they are safe and have no flaws. 

<br>

## The Data Analyst ##
With a coffee in hand, she gets to work by eight,
<br> and then analzyes metrics like the customer retention rate.

Her job is to report numbers to supoort her business
<br> and make sense of data that looks like a big mess.

She codes in tools like R, SQL, and Stata.
<br> These tools help her create order in the data.

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 1 ##
One night, Gabby complained to mama, "I had a terrible day today".
<br> Gabby then said, "nothing at all went my way!"

Mama responded, "that's ok" but encouraged Gabby to have an attitude of gratitude.
<br> "But be thankful", she told Gabby, "because that will help you have a joyful mood!"

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings.
<br> And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright.
<br> And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

"There's so much", Gabby said, "to be grateful for!"
<br> "I am going to think of more and more and more!"

"I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend.
<br> The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

I am grateful for my teacher who teaches us how to read.
<br> Today we read a book by Jory John, which is called 'The Bad Seed'.

I am grateful for the lunch server who always smiles at my classmates and me.
<br> She's always wearing a pretty bracelet that says 'Be Free'.

I am grateful for recess when we went to the playground.
<br> Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school.
<br> Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for the spaghetti my brother and I ate for dinner.
<br> The pasta was so good because it was thinner."

Then Gabby said, "Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer.
<br> Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is indeed the answer!"

"Good job on being grateful", said mama. "This list is yours to keep.
<br> And now that you've developed this list, you can sweetly sleep".

"Good night", said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss.
<br> "Tomorrow night I will share another list."

<br>

## Gabby's Gratitude List - version 2 ##
Every night Gabby snuggled in bed with mama. 
<br> And every night Gabby and mama talked about how the day went in their pajamas. 

One night before bedtime, Gabby complained to mama, “I had a terrible day today”. 
<br> Gabby then said, “nothing at all went my way!”

“I’m so sorry”, said mama, “what happened?
<br> What has made you feel so saddened and maddened?”

“I forgot to set my alarm clock last night,” said Gabby, “and that led me to miss the bus.
<br> Then, when I got to school late, my teacher made a big fuss. 

When we had coloring time I did not get to use my favorite crayon. 
<br> When I looked in the box for my favorite purple one it was gone. 

Someone in my class spilled juice on me, and it got on my shirt. 
<br> Unfortunately it also stained my new skirt!

There was a leak in the roof, and I got wet.
<br> Getting wet made me feel so upset. 

At recess, while running and playing tag, I slipped. 
<br> Because I fell on the ground, my t-shirt ripped.

And tonight for dinner we ate a disgusting meal. 
<br> It was a grownup dish that had in it salmon and eel.” 

Mama responded, “I understand. That all sounds terrible.
<br> I’m sure right now life feels really unbearable.”

“But,” mama said “I encourage you to keep an attitude of gratitude.
<br> Being thankful will help you stay in a joyful mood!

You can pay attention to all the good things that happen too. 
<br> And when you think of these things, you won’t feel as blue.”

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings. 
<br> And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright. 
<br> And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

“There’s so much”, Gabby said, “to be grateful for!
<br> I am going to think of more and more and more!

I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend. 
<br> The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

<br> Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school. 
<br> Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for my brother’s and my dinner, which was macaroni and cheese. 
<br> I even tried the vegetables my dad made and liked the peas.”

Then Gabby said, “Thinking of all these things sure is a mood enhancer. 
<br> Now I know that feeling grateful for everything is the answer!”

“Sometimes life does not always go my way.
<br> But if I remember the good things that happen, it brightens the day.”

“Good job on being grateful”, said mama. “This list is yours to keep. 
<br> And now that you’ve developed this list, you can sweetly sleep”.

“Good night”, said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss. 
<br> “Tomorrow night I will share another list.”

## A World Filled with Love ##
A mailman takes letters to each house in town. 
<br> While walking he smiles at a woman with a frown. 

The woman then began to smile too. 
<br> When she got home she made her sick neighbor some stew. 

When eating the stew the neighbor began to feel better. 
<br> When she got out of bed she knitted her friend a sweater. 

The friend loved feeling cozy and warm. 
<br> To give back, she provided shelter to a family caught in a storm. 

The family was grateful that they had a place to stay dry. 
<br> While in shelter the family made their teacher a pie. 

The teacher was happy to have a sweet treat to eat. 
<br> She gave out clothes to people in need on the street. 

The people were glad to have something to wear. 
<br> The people wrote thank you notes to a preacher with a prayer. 

The preacher rejoiced that people were thinking of him. 
<br> He rolled the wheelchair of a man with a broken limb. 

The man appreciated he could go to the park. 
<br> To another man there he shared a kind remark. 

The other man was delighted with what the man said. 
<br> The other man continued to share love, and throughout the town the love spread. 

So the lesson is that one small thing can lead to a world filled with love.
<br> For love is what we’re all truly born of.

<br> 

## life is forever evolving ##
rivers flow into the sea.
<br> where they meet’s an estuary.
<br> a seed becomes a tree,
<br> where birds can nest and be free.

life is forever evolving.
<br> no day is ever the same.
<br> the world is continuously revolving,
<br> so nature can reach its aim.

leaves change from green to gold.
<br> humans grow from young to old;
<br> they too grow from simple to wise.
<br> and life continues when a leaf dies. 

<br> caterpillars transform into butterflies.
<br> other creatures also metamorphosize.
<br> chemicals and metals alchemize.
<br> dreams are born and then crystallize.

life is forever evolving.
<br> no day is ever the same.
<br> the world is continuously revolving,
<br> so nature can reach its aim.

a blue sky becomes one of rainshowers,
<br> which leads buds to blossom into flowers. 
<br> bees create honey out of nectar.
<br> all of the earth is connected.

life is forever evolving.
<br> no day is ever the same.
<br> the world is continuously revolving,
<br> so nature can reach its aim.

the same sun that sets will rise.
<br> and it’s light causes things to energize.
<br> the moon turns from a crescent to a whole.
<br> the earth is always spinning its poles.

life is forever evolving.
<br> no day is ever the same.
<br> the world is continuously revolving,
<br> so nature can reach its aim.

## poetic lifelines ##
my life's dependent on reading and writing poetry;
<br> poems are my lifeline: they compliment psychiatry.
<br> bringing words together in rhyme and rhythm
<br> helps me face down any psychological schism.
<br> capturing feelings, observations, and sights,
<br> like the light shining on the darknest of nights,
<br> is what gives me my spark despite the darkness in my soul,
<br> and is what helps me feel more fulfilled, engaged, and whole.
<br> plus, i think the God of the universe is a poet
<br> and all the psalms, and songs, really go to show it.
<br> so i think God, who is Life's measured author,
<br> wants us to hang onto poems and all that they offer.

<br>

## poetry blooms in spring ##
the divinity of Spring's artistry
<br> leads poetry to bloom,
<br> as buds do in May,
<br> with flowery words,
<br> which writers use fullheartedly
<br> to color, to illume,
<br> and to make fresh eash day.

with the trees blossoming, and the grass growing,
<br> and with the people frolicking, and gladness o'erflowing,
<br> for poets,
<br> there's a world of delight
<br> to sew into seams,
<br> of a tapestry of words
<br> that express renewed gleams.

as the word is rejuvenating, after a season of hibernating,
<br> it's that time of year,
<br> when,
<br> one can find poetry
<br> in all things;
<br> and lucky is the poet,
<br> whose career it is,
<br> to capture nature's flourishing.

as words tumble from florets,
<br> it's hard for poets to ignore it;
<br> the flower's composites
<br> can't help but rouse
<br> the next winning laureates.

so listen intently during this season:
<br> you'll hear
<br> not only the songs of the birds,
<br> but also the writer's words
<br> that capture
<br> that capture life's rhythm, rhyme, and reason.

<br>

## Good Going On Today ##
i wake up and make the bed.
<br> i make sure that i am fed.
<br> i put on my boots and walk out the door.
<br> i am ready to see what this day has in store.

i get in my car, and i put in the keys.
<br> i’ve got my window down, and i’m feeling the breeze.
<br> the radio is on; I’m listening to the news.
<br> there are stories of people creating new products to use. 

i arrive at my workplace and walk in and say hello.
<br> it’s a new day on the grind; this i know.
<br> so i turn on my laptop and I get to work.
<br> i put my mind on my projects and refuse to shirk.

someone comes over and invites me to lunch.
<br> i say of course i’ll go and enjoy a munch.
<br> we talk about work and how the day is.
<br> the day's going well, i've been down to biz.

in the pm i leave work and go for a walk.
<br> i get on the phone with my mom for a talk. 
<br> outside i see someone doing a kind deed.
<br> every kind deed is a little seed.

after the walk i get home, and i rest.
<br> i remember all the good things that make me feel blessed.

Chorus: 
there’s good going on today, so why don’t i sing.
<br> i am glad about all the things that the good Lord brings.
<br> the sun is shining, the birds are chirping.
<br> the world is moving,  the people are smiling.

## Because I'm a Woman, I Can ##
I’m driving my car with no place to go 
<br> I’m flipping through stations on the radio
<br> I’m finding joy in the journey of flying solo 
<br> And learning to be free and let the past go

I’m going through Tennessee and Indiana 
<br> Wisconsin, Missouri, and Louisiana  
<br> Like Geoff Mack and JCash, I’m going everywhere, man 
<br> I’m going all these places because as a woman I can 

I’ve been through my share of breakups and heartbreaks
<br> I’ve also made my share of dreadful mistakes 
<br> But I’m putting the past in the rearview mirror
<br> And I’m ready to see life a little bit clearer 

I’m going through Tennessee and Indiana 
<br> Wisconsin, Missouri, and Louisiana  
<br> Like Geoff Mack and JCash, I’m going everywhere, man 
<br> I’m going all these places because as a woman I can 

Traveling these roads brings freedom to me 
<br> I feel like I can truly and independently be
<br> I’ve been singing in my heart every day’s a new day 
<br> Every day is a new day for life on the highway 

I’ve been to Tennessee, Missouri, and Indiana 
<br> Wisconsin, Georgia, and Louisiana  
<br> Like Geoff Mack and JCash, I’ve been going everywhere, man
<br> I’m going all these places; as a woman I can 

I’ve been meeting all sorts of people here and there 
<br> I’ve been learning that there are good people everywhere 
<br> The people, they come from many different walks of life 
<br> Stories to tell with which they are rife 

I’ve been to Tennessee, Missouri, and Indiana 
<br> Wisconsin, Georgia, and Louisiana  
<br> Like Geoff Mack and JCash, I’ve been going everywhere, man 
<br> I’m going all these places because as a woman I can 

<br> 

## My Heart Lies in the Country ##
For a few days I’ve been in the city 
<br> Enjoying the skyline which is so pretty 
<br> But my heart must return to the country now 
<br> I’ve got to get back to the farm somehow  

There’s nothing like the fields of grass that grows 
<br> There’s nothing like the nearby river that flows 
<br> There’s nothing like the cows that moo
<br> There’s nothing like the sky so blue 

This farm is my home
<br> Wherever I roam 
<br> My heart lives in the country forever 

There’s nothing like the truck that’s red
<br> There’s nothing like the cornbread 
<br> There’s nothing like the fresh grown food 
<br> There’s nothing like the quietude 

This farm is my home
<br> Wherever I roam 
<br> My heart forever lives in the country 

I’ll take a train southbound
<br> Into this small town
<br> So that I can return home 

This farm is my home
<br> Wherever I roam 
<br> My heart lives in the country forever 

<br>

## flying solo ##
there's a bird sitting on the fence alone. <br>
<br> she lifts her wings so gracefully. <br>
<br> how I long to be like this lone bird, peacefully knowing who I am. <br>

<br>

## the lone bird ##
the lone bird flies high through the spring trees. <br>
the lone bird sits still on the ground. <br>
the lone bird sails gracefully on the yellow driving sign. <br>
the lone bird rests on a walking sign. <br>
the lone bird launches and lands onto a brown tree branch.  <br>
the lone bird flutters with the wind amongst the green leaves. <br>
the lone bird rises high in the sky. <br>
the lone bird perches on the electric wire. <br>
the lone bird glides with the wind. <br>
the lone bird pecks at the lead.  <br>
the lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground. <br>
the lone bird stands on a fence. <br>
the lone bird finds her support on the power line. <br>

## girl, stop ##
girl, stop, and take a look.
<br> you've got a smile to wear.
<br> you've got a style to share.
<br> please take a hard look.

<br> you are wonderful.
<br> you are beautiful.
<br> so mirror, mirror,
<br> please see a little clearer.

<br>

## written in lipstick on the mirror ##
it’s amazing 
<br> how often i go to the bathroom, 
<br> thinking the thoughts,
<br> “i am ugly”. 
<br> but what use is it 
<br> to carry these thoughts around each day. 
<br> if you can’t change yourself, 
<br> change your perception;
<br> at least those are some words of wisdom. 
<br> so i’ve written the words,
<br> “i”
<br> “am”
<br> “beautiful”
<br> in red lipstick on the mirror, 
<br> with the hope that 
<br> some red, smudgy words
<br> remind me 
<br> to look through the mirror  
with a view that’s clearer,
<br> doing the trick. 
<br> and also
<br> hopefully the thoughts,
<br> “i am ugly”
<br> go down the drain 
<br> with the makeup that 
<br> i wash off of my hands. 
<br> “i’m not a woman, 
<br> i’m a beautiful woman”,
<br> i learn 
<br> to proclaim in the bathroom. 

<br> 

## to reveal all, i - ##
to reveal all, i -
<br> sometimes cry, and then sigh.
<br> i sometimes can't stop
<br> but let the tears drop
<br> and then feel a huge release
<br> before i sigh, and regain my peace.

<br>

## my own way ##
momma’s never left shelby county
<br> and don’t want nobody telling her what to do
<br> but I got faraway dreams, ain’t no townie 
<br> this place is just for passing through 

<br>

## but not today ##
i’ve been crying, crying, crying <br>
but not today <br>
learning to leave it in yesterday <br>

<br>

## joy sprouts from the earth ##
as the tulips trumpet and the daisies dance,
<br> i feel the joy sprouting from the earth. 
<br> as the birds chirp and the rabbits hop, 
<br> i witness this season’s worth. 
<br> as souls rejuvenate in sunbeams and beings renew their hope,
<br> i sing along in gratitude for a spiritual rebirth.  

<br> 

## getting better ##
it is may now.
<br> the weather no longer demands i wear a sweater, so i am getting better.
<br> i can wear short-sleeved tops, along with my flip-flops; and in the sun, i can sit for hours amdist the grass and the flowers.
<br> i can drink my favorite drinks with ice, like i am in paradise, and i can go pick fresh berries to eat with ice cream from the dairies.
<br> i can put my car window down while i'm driving all through town; and i can have a picnic in the park while hearing the sound of the meadowlark.
<br> i can clean out my house while pulling out my favorite blouse; and i can have an outside yard sale, selling things like a painting of a whale.
<br> what more can i love than to enjoy the warmth that comes during the year's best month?
<br> it is may now.
<br> the weather no longer demands i wear a sweater, so i am getting better.

## another version of you ##
on this day of independence, America, i am envisioning another version of you: a version where everyone, *truly*, can find the life, liberty, and happiness, which the declaration gives all the right to pursue.

while the old version of you excluded some, based on race, religion, ethnicity, and gender, i hope that peace, safety, and security, and creativity, abundance, and joy are what for all you render.

no longer i want to see the systemic violence breaking our people apart at the seams; rahter i want to see the fruition of even young children's fresh dreams.

i believe in you, America, for all that you stand, and my wish this day is for all of us to belong to your land.

## summer did not start off hesitantly ##
what is going on? it's 100 degrees in june.
<br> how's it so hot? how's it so hot this soon?
<br> thus, i'd say summer did not start off hesitantly.
<br> no, not with this whether...it started rather unquestioningly.
<br> we've still got two months left, and it's only getting hotter.
<br> so  make sure each day to drink all of your water.

## this month radiates prismatic energy ##
this month is june. do you know what that means?
<br> it's the month for rainbow colors from red to purple to green.
<br> it's the month for prismatic energy to radiate...
<br> ...through the diverse ways people march and celebrate.
<br> it's the month for people to raise the flag...
<br> ...and pull out all of their colorful swag.
<br> it's the month for lgbtqia+ fully to take pride...
<br> ...and feel love for themselves; they've got nothing to hide.
<br> at least lgbtqia+ have got nothing to hide from me...
<br> for i have grown more aware through members of my family.
<br> so if you identify as lgbqia+, don't let  your glow be extinguished...
<br> ...and don't let your way of loving be ever relinquished.

## the stained-glass window ##
in my home, there’s a window, through which the sun can shine. 
<br> the red, heart-shaped center represents st. valentine. 
<br> surrounding the heart is a stained glass handiwork.
<br> of blue, green, and yellow, it's a clouded patchwork. 
<br> the colors grow bright, when steeped in the sun's beams,
<br> and the floor courts it’s shadows as the light gleams. 

<br> 

## big red bow ##
there is nothing like a big red bow
<br> that I can put on top of a gift for you
<br> or tie in my hair for a classic do
<br> or wrap around the church pew.

## Peaceful Chaos ##
from jam-packed parking lots to long lines in the airport, it is the time of year of peaceful chaos. people are rushing to buy ingredients for their holiday party, shopping at the last minute for the presents for their family, and arriving to the airport extra early to make their flight on time…like everyone else is. it also can feel like the to do list is so long that one never checks everything off…the things to do are endless. but amidst all the hustle and bustle, there are glimmers of good cheer, with people excited to give and receive, and the promise of Jesus Christ, who brought peace and good will to all mankind, motivating the season.

## 'tis the season ##
‘tis the season for hanging up Christmas ornaments 
<br> and decorating the house with other adornments. 
<br> my favorite I’d say are wreaths and peppermints. 

‘tis the season for stockings filled with presents galore,
<br> thanks to Santa who bought everything in the store. 
<br> the best gift I’ve gotten is a book on folklore. 

'tis the season for going with neighbors caroling 
<br> and then drinking some eggnog and reveling. 
<br> there’s the good news of Christ we can enjoy heralding. 

‘tis the season for lights, both fire and candlelight. 
<br> and ‘tis the season for twinkling stars shining at night. 
<br> in the darkness there’s a world filled with things merry and bright. 

'tis the season for traveling home to see family for the holiday
<br> and driving miles and miles on winding roads and the highway,
<br> while listening to Christmas music that radio stations play.

<br> 

## driving home for the holiday ##
eager to travel home to see family for the holiday that is filled with all things merry and bright, and shades of red and green, a throng of cars drive like flocks of birds flying in the sky, along winding roads, and between white dotted lines. 

the golden sun shines through the brown and barren trees, and every radio station plays Christmas music, at least intermittently.

every other mile, there stands a blue sign marking the next gas station or fast food restaurant, where gracious people stand behind logos like cracker barrell, mcdonald’s, and exxon and are ready to let you use the restroom, if not take your cash in exchange for a meal.
