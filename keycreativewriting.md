## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
<br> with a heart yearning to express itself.
<br>
<br> In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
<br> with ivory yearning to be tickled.
<br>
<br>'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
<br> with stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
<br> and in return she receives a great gift.
<br>
<br>Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
<br> Her eyes no longer shed tears.
<br> Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
<br> Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
<br> Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
<br> Her heart has found freedom.
<br> And her mind has found relief.
<br>
<br> She is now content
<br> with the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing music on the keys,
she discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

## What Can America Achieve? Diamante Poem ##
Despair,
enormous, steep,
scorching, perishing, callousing,
The climb is summoned by a new spirit -
overcoming, unyielding, conquering,
bright, energetic,
Hope.

<br>

## A New Day ##
It's a new day for the sun to shine.
Wake up, and be free. The day is yours, and the day is mine.

It's a really great day for the sky to be blue.
Look up high! And see the birds soaring too!

On this new day the birds really sing.
It's fun to sing with the birds and hear their songs ringaling.

It's a new day for the earth to move.
It's amazing how all the people really get into a groove.

On this new day I've got two feet on the ground.
It's love that makes the world go around.

It's a really great day to go out and seize the day.
Neighbors wave, and people laugh and play.

It's a new day to run and skip outside.
It's more wonderful to do this with friends by my side.

On this new day I wear a smile on my face.
I do all that I need to do with a heart filled with grace.

## Gabby's Gratitude List ##
One night, Gabby complained to mama, "I had a terrible day today".
Gabby then said, "nothing at all went my way!"

Mama responded, "that's ok" but encouraged Gabby to have an attitude of gratitude.
"But be thankful", she told Gabby, "because that will help you have a joyful mood!"

So each new day Gabby started going around and counting her blessings.
And each night with mama she started remembering all of the little things.

One night, Gabby listed things like the warm sun that was bright.
And she listed things like her favorite dress with a bow, which was blue and white.

"There's so much", Gabby said, "to be grateful for!"
"I am going to think of more and more and more!"

"I am grateful for the bus ride to school when I sat by Lucy, my new friend.
The windows were down on the bus today, and we could feel the coolness of the wind.

I am grateful for my teacher who teaches us how to read.
Today we read a book by Jory John, which is called 'The Bad Seed'.

I am grateful for the lunch server who always smiles at my classmates and me.
She's always wearing a pretty bracelet that says 'Be Free'.

I am grateful for recess when we went to the playground.
Today we played basketball, and I got the rebound.

I am grateful for the time to have fun after school.
Today I got to go to practice swimming at the pool.

I am grateful for the spaghetti my brother and I ate for dinner.
The pasta was so good because it was thinner."

"Good job on being grateful", said mama. "This list is yours to keep.
And now that you've developed this list, you can sweetly sleep".

"Good night", said Gabby to mama, as they shared a kiss.
"Tomorrow night I will share another list."

## Boots ##
These boots of mine that I love. They've really been everywhere. <br>
They've walked down many roads. <br>
They've dug their heels into the dirt. <br>
Can't you see? They've really been worn. <br>

These worn-down boots that I love. They've traveled the world. <br>
They've stepped on rocks. <br>
They've run through grass. <br>
Can't you see? They have some holes in the soles. <br>

These beloved boots are mine. They've been my best friend. <br>
They've gone down lonely pathways. <br>
They've skipped across sidewalks. <br>
Can't you see? They've become sturdy and strong. <br>

These wonderful boots that I love. I keep them tied real tight. <br>
They've kept me feeling snug. <br>
They're as comfortable as can be. <br>
Can't you see? They're my favorite. <br>

These boots of mine that I love. They've really gone the extra mile. <br>
They've done more than I could've asked for. <br>
They've survived the hard work. <br>
Can't you see? There's some pep in every step with them. <br>

<br>

## Just Live ##
Just live. <br>
It's all you have got to do. <br>
Truly live. <br>
Take it all in. <br>
Do something new. <br>
Have a good laugh. <br>
Dance on the street. <br>
Play some great music. <br>
Live. <br>
Really live. <br>

<br>

## I Am One in A Sea ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to say something kind.

I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.

I am a body in a sea of bodies learning to be free.

I am a heart in a sea of hearts crying out to love more.

I am a set of eyes in a sea of eyes looking to see the good.

## The American Chain, Written in 2010 ##
As a child, I grew up singing "I Am Proud To Be an American" like many of my peers. I never knew what it mean to be an American though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race. As Crevecoeur explains Americans, "we have no princes for whom we toil, starve, and bleed...Here man is free as he ought to be, nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are". The American country gives a sense of opportunity to every unique individual. The American people volunteer their time to help other American people. If these characteristics of America are not fully true, they are a common goal for what our country will become; we continue to work towards these goals constantly. Lazarus illustrates that America welcomes even "the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free" (pp. 11-12, 329).

A little over a year ago, in February 2008, I was at the Barack Obama rally where 18,000 people attended. When Mr. Barack Obama began his speech, the responses from everyone in the audience gave a feel of community support. Everyone was there for a common reason: to support Mr. Obama, to support the Democrats, and most of all to support the United Sates of America. I felt love from each person standing near me. Everyone stood in a tight place for over two hours, but I heard no complaints; everyone worked together to make the rally successful.

I had a similar experience in October 2008 when I went to another Barack Obama rally at the Tides' Stadium one week before the election. This event strengthened my love of being present in a community of Americans. Everyone had to behave and work together in the thirty degree weather to make the rally successful. Once again, each person I saw expressed friendliness and happiness. People stood in line patiently for hours before entering the stadium. Friends and neighbors helped each other when rushing through security. Volunteers gave their time to guide people to open seats.

Finally, in January 2009, on the Inaugaration Day, although I was not there, I watched the big event on television. As I watched the millions of people there, I could feel the presence of a true society. That day was truly a day full of nonpartisanship and support for America from everyone. Everyone supported Barack Obama on this day, a day of uniting America together. I not only truly felt like an American on that special day, but I also loved being an American. I wanted to make a difference for my country.

Throughout Obama's campaign and these three events, because I have grown love for my country and understand the meaning of America, I have challenged myself to give back to this society. I decided to go to Monroe Elementary on Tuesday and Thrusday afternoons when I did not have activities after school. I have helped children who do not have the same privileges in their households with their homework through the *Homework Help* program. I have done this with the Park Place Childlife Center. The children may not be able to have read as well, or have made as good grades as other children their age, but they all have had such big hearts and love for people in general. The children have all suppported each other and pushed each other to do their homework. The relationships between the students and my relationships to the students represent the American culture.

Because of the three events during Barack Obama's campaign and inauguration, I have realized the good of the American people, and I have learned the importance of giving back to my country. I can now declare that I understand the meaning of America. Through storm or shine, our country can fight its challenges with the help of each individual. Each individual is like a link in the chain. Each individual can also be represented as a bead in Dillard's notion where "each bead is transparent and each has a world, or the same world, light and alive and apparent inside the drop" (p. 577). Each individual, despite his class, race, or gender matters. Each individual can contribute something to our society. Each individual has the opportunity to grow if he learns to work hard. If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

As a child, I grew up singing "I Am proud to be an American" as many of my peers did. I did not know what it meant to be an American as deeply as recently though. In the past campaign and election of President Barack Obama, I gained a stronger sense of the meaning of America. The American society consists of unique individuals expressing freedom through their voices, their words, their clothes, and their activities, despite one's gender or race.

If one link or bead fell, the chain would break, I believe in the American chain of people.

Since writing this, I have continued to see the meaning of America. When reading Vice President Kamala Harris's book, I saw how the words of Lazarus influence her work helping people in need as a political leader; and when watching the fourth of July festivities in Washington, DC I saw the huddle of Americans expressing cheer, renewal, and love for diversity. I hope to continue to stand witness to the meaning of America heading into the future.

## The Democratic Republic and the Debate Inside My Head ##
Two parties of people govern the nation. Each party represents a set of ideas for how to represent the people, a set of philosophies for how to govern people with order, and a set of ways to handle collective challenges. No party has absolute control. The party in control has representative power over a set of people and over the collective whole. The party not in control also represents another set of people. The governmental structure builds in a space for dialogue, or a debate that gives room for disagreement that can yield to agreement. Not everyone has to agree, but everyone should point their thought to the greater good that supports the life, love, and soul that exists within people's hearts and minds. New ideas can evolve out of conflict and disagreement, leading to something better than before. A new nation is built everytime conflict erupts so destructively. A republic (government is a "public matter"): "a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch". The republic constitutes the entire region. The national government represents each state's government, which should represent the people, including the minority, in each state. Representatives decide the rules and make the laws. Education helps to provide people with liberty, life, happiness, health, and purpose. Everyone has a piece of the representation, and a right to function and to live well. The majority rules, and the minority is represented to protect the inherent rights of the people. A democracy (government is ruled "by the people"): "a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives." The government supports everyone having an informed voice, the government represents the majority of the voice to meet their needs, and voices make the laws through their votes. Everyone has inherent rights. The debate over which set of ideas, or system of government runs in my head. I feel like I can understand both sides, I can see from both perspectives, I may not understand enough to make a firm judgment, I may not know all of the details to voice a strong opinion. The United States of America is a Democratic Republic in that the Government is ruled by an elected group, hears and supports the minority's voice, and expresses the needs of the majority. The United States of America is a representational democracy. [Citing Republic vs. Democracy](https://www.thoughtco.com/republic-vs-democracy-4169936)

## Flying Solo - Rough Draft ##
There's a bird sitting on the fence alone. <br>
She lifts her wings so gracefully. <br>
How I long to be like this lone bird, peacefully knowing who I am. <br>

<br>

## The Lone Bird ##
The lone bird flies high through the spring trees. <br>
The lone bird sits still on the ground. <br>
The lone bird sails gracefully on the yellow driving sign. <br>
The lone bird rests on a walking sign. <br>
The lone bird launches and lands onto a brown tree branch.  <br>
The lone bird flutters with the wind amongst the green leaves. <br>
The lone bird rises high in the sky. <br>
The lone bird perches on the electric wire. <br>
The lone bird mounts on the street sign. <br>
The lone bird glides with the wind. <br>
The lone bird pecks at the lead.  <br>
The lone bird flaps his wings just above the ground. <br>
The lone bird stands on a fence. <br>
The lone bird explores her freedom. <br>
The lone bird finds her support on the power line. <br>
The lone bird scurries through the grass. <br>
The lone bird expands her wings. <br>
The lone bird swoops down to hover the river. <br>
The lone bird feathers her wings above the water. <br>
The lone bird stands on the grass near the farm holding her poise. <br>
The lone bird skates on the ice. <br>
The lone bird knows her place on the wire. <br>

## Smile Like You Mean It ##
Smile like you mean it. <br>
In the pain, and the tears, and the fight within, smile like you mean it. <br>
In the loss for words, and the heartbreak, smile that winning smile. <br>
You smile like a ray of light. <br>
Your face lights up the whole room and brightens someone's day. <br>
Your face makes someone feel at ease and cheers someone's heart. <br>
Smile like you mean it. <br>
Let the glow shine. <br>
Your smile is yours to share, and it is yours to wear. <br>

<br>

## Girl, Stop ##
Girl, stop, and take a look.
You got a smile to wear.
You got a style to share.
Please take a hard look.

You are wonderful.
You are beautiful.
So mirror, mirror,
please see a little clearer.

## It is Ok ##
It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to let the heart tear inside. <br>
It's ok to let the tears flow. <br>
It's ok to let it break inside. <br>
It's ok to let the heart ache. <br>
It's ok to feel. <br>
It's ok. Let it out. <br>
It's ok to express emotions and thoughts. <br>
Sometimes the anger and other emotions mask the need to cry and to feel. <br>
It is ok. <br>

It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to feel. <br> 
It should feel good to sing. <br>

It's ok to cry. <br>
It's ok to let the tears flow. <br>
It's ok to cry. <br>
It's like the water droplets after a heavy rain. <br>

<br>

## Truth ##
The truth can be ugly. <br>
The truth can be tough to bear. <br>
The truth cannot be lied about. <br>
The truth is hard to hide. <br>
The truth can be uncovered. <br>
The truth is real. <br>
The truth is just. <br>
The truth is beautiful. <br>
The truth is within. <br>
The truth is there. <br>
The truth is free. <br>
The truth is light. <br>
The truth lifts her wings in a world full of colors. <br>
The truth lives on. <br>
The truth is at the center. <br>
The truth is within everyone's hearts. <br>
The truth raises her voice. <br>
The truth shares her wisdom. <br>

<br>

## My Own Way ##
Momma’s never left Shelby County <br>
And don’t want nobody telling her what to do <br>
But I got faraway dreams, ain’t no townie <br>
This place is just for passing through <br>

<br>

## But Not Today ##
I’ve been crying, crying, crying <br>
But not today <br>
Learning to leave it in yesterday <br>
