## An English teacher who taught creative writing to students in high school inspired students to write down observations creatively. Another English teacher in high school who taught the American Credo Project empowered students to discover a passion for literature and music. I love creative writing supports expressing feelings and thoughts. The author Rachel Held Evans shares the fact that some people have discovered that The Psalmist serves as a great psychologist in her book entitled *Inspired: Slaying Giants, Walking on Water, and Loving the Bible Again* (p. 109). I agree with this discovery, and I am experimenting with writing poetry. I write a little bit each day and edit a little bit each day. It would be fun to teach youth in my life and help them learn to use their voice. ##

## Creative writing starts with observation and articulation. Creative writing comes from verbalizing visual and auditory observations and articulating feelings and experiences. Creative writing stems from asking interesting questions and imagining. ##

## In the American Credo project, I remember composing a song on the piano, and taking photos of music and water. This journey of writing music and setting poetry to music continues. ##

## In the Creative Writing class, I remember writing down goals to explore how children's books and the media help to teach children concepts. I compared Disney to PBS Kids, and I wrote down goals of writing children's books. An exploration of best practices of writing books for children continues. ##

## People encourage engineers to write poetry as well. In engineering, people write snippets of code, structure code logically and creatively, and think in and about systems. In poetry, people write snippets of words, and learn to structure words and code creatively and logically. ##

## Through a career, I hope to work as a liberal engineer, bringing together culture, social sciences, history, literature, and engineering. I also hope to explore teaching students at the elementary, high school, or college levels. ##

## The Friend ##
Sitting in a dark room, she sits alone
With a heart yearning to express itself.

In another dark room nearby, a piano sits alone
With ivory yearning to be tickled.

'Why cannot the piano be my friend?' she thinks.
With stiff legs she introduces herself to Steinway,
and in return she receives a great gift.

Her body is no longer stiff, no longer limited.
Her eyes no longer shed tears.
Her fingers dance across the black and white keys.
Her ears open up and hear the sound of music.
Her soul spreads its wings and flies.
Her heart has found freedom.
And her mind has found relief.

She is now content
With the company of a friend.

<br>

## Children's Play ##
Playing on the keys without words,
She discovers a joy and a light in the sound that reminds her of little children on a playground.

The sound alone tells a colorful story of the youthfulness that bounces with joy.

## E Pluribus Unum ##
I am a voice in a sea of voices yearning to be say the right thing.

I am a conscience in a sea of consciences desiring to do the right thing.

I am a body in a sea of bodies wanting to be free.

I am a heart in a sea of hearts crying out to love more.

I am a set of eyes in a set of eyes looking to see the good going on.

I am one of a kind in the sea of humanity.

Like a drop of water ripples outwardly, I am one of many leading to ripples outwardly in a sea of ripples.

I am one in a million. There are a million ways to say and do the same thing.

## Secret Admirer ##
He had a secret admirer but he didn't know her name.

Every day, she came home and peeled off petals from flowers.

'He likes me, he likes me not'
'He likes me, he likes me not'
'He likes me, he likes me not'

All the petals fell to the grass as she repeated this sentence.

She smiled and said, 'I hope he likes me' as she let the petals fall to the ground.

She took the flower petals to school and said, 'I like you a lot, and here are some flower petals for you.'

He responded, 'I like you too' and took the petals in his hand.

He made a necklace out of the petals, and he went up to her and said, 'this necklace is for you, and let's be friends.'

She wore the necklace every day to school, and he would smile at her across the room.

They held hands, and they became best friends forever.

What a wonderful type of love that starts with a flower and its petals.
